Instructors must include the Conditions of Use statement in their course syllabus.\n\n \n\nOverview\nTurnitin is a tool that will assist in detecting textual similarities between compared works. Instructors must exercise their independent professional judgment in looking at originality report and must assume responsibility for determining whether a text has been plagiarized.  Turnitin is used for course work only. \nTurnitin is an integrated tool/option in Quercus. It appears as an option when creating an Assignment. \nWith the Turnitin integration in Quercus courses, class and assignment setup using the Turnitin.com website is not supported at U of T.\n \n\nConditions of Use at the University of Toronto\nBefore setting up a Turnitin Assignment item instructors should be aware of the following:\n1.  Instructors must include the following passage on the course outline at the start of the class. \n\nCopy the text below and paste it in your course outline.\n\nPlease note that the statement was prepared by the University lawyers and cannot be altered in any way.\n“Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to Turnitin.com for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of the Turnitin.com service are described on the Turnitin.com web site.”\n2. Students are permitted, under our conditions of use, to opt-out of using Turnitin. \nIf a student chooses not to submit their assignment through Turnitin instructors will need to find alternative arrangements to check their work as rigorously. (note that over the past five years, very few students have opted out.) Students cannot be penalized for choosing to opt out. \n3. For any student who does not submit to Turnitin, instructors can manually enter their grade in the same Gradebook column that includes the assignments that were submitted through the Turnitin assignment in your Quercus course.\nFor information on alternative methods to submitting to Turnitin see this page from the Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation.\n \n\nStep-by-step instructions\nTurnitin assignments are an option when you create an assignment in your Quercus course.\n1. Select Assignments from the left side menu and the \"+ Assignment\" button at top right OR  if creating this from within a module, select the the \"+\" button (and select Assignment> [New Assignment])\n2. Within the assignments setting page, when you reach the \"Submission Type\" section, in the drop down, select \"Online\" and make sure \"File Uploads\" is clicked  (you can also give the option of \"Text entry\" if you wish).\n\n3. Select Turnitin from the Plagiarism Review drop-down menu that will appear.\n\n4. Customize the Turnitin plagiarism settings to suit your assignment. There is a setting at the bottom of the list to show the originality report to students. Instructors can choose whether students will be able to view the similarity reports. By default the option is set to share the similarity reports with students \"immediately\". Selecting \"never\" from the drop down menu will not display the similarity reports to students.\nDetailed instructions from Turnitin on creating a Turnitin assignment in Canvas\n \n\nSimilarity Reports\nTurnitin page on Similarity Reports (accessing, viewing and interpreting the report)\nFor each paper submitted, a Similarity Report (formerly called \"Originality Report\") is generated by Turnitin. Once analyzed, similarity reports, highlighting questionable areas, are generated within 5-10 minutes. Similarity Reports for the second or subsequent submissions will take up to 24 hours to generate. This report highlights any suspicious passages that match other materials in the Turnitin database or on the web.\nSimilarity Reports do not indicate whether a student has plagiarized but helps to identify sources that contain textual similarities in submitted papers. The instructor must use his/her own judgment to determine if plagiarism has occurred.\nFor more information on Originality Reports, please see Understanding Turnitin and the Similarity Report (PDF) from U of T's Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation.\n \n\nContacts for Academic Integrity Support\nInstructors who have questions about the process for the handling of suspected academic offences should contact their department/division (in many cases this would be the undergraduate chair or associate chair/dean).\nIn addition, divisional offices (or individuals) are also available to provide advice regarding particular academic integrity issues or to discuss a specific situation. These include:\n\nAcademic Integrity at the University of Toronto\nFaculty of Arts & Science: Kristi Gourlay, Manager, Office of Student Academic Integrity at 416-946-5810 or kristi.gourlay@utoronto.ca \n\nSchool of Graduate Studies: General Inquiries at graduate.information@utoronto.ca\n\nU of T Mississauga: Lucy Gaspini, Manager, Academic Affairs, Office of the Dean\nU of T Scarborough:  Nisha Panchal, Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Officer\n"},{"title":"Student Quercus Guide","slug":"student-quercus-guide","lastUpdated":"2018-10-24T12:48:11Z","published":true,"url":"https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/student-quercus-guide","body":"On This Page\n\nWhy Quercus?\n\nCourse Access\n\nUTORid\nCourse Not Appearing on Dashboard\nRemove a Course from Appearing on Your Dashboard\nChange Your Name as it Appears in Quercus\n\n\n\nIntroduction and Overview\n\nMobile App\n\n\nFind Your Way Around Quercus\nYour Responsibility as a Student for Course Notifications and Email\nView Grades\nView Calendar\nSupport Resources for Quercus (Canvas)\nSelf-Paced Videos\n\nQuestions\n\nUTORid\nEmail\nWireless\n\n\n\n \nWhy Quercus?\nQuercus (powered by Canvas) is U of T's new academic toolbox. Log in to Quercus to access the online portion of your courses.\n\n \nCourse Access\nHow do I log in?\nThe Quercus (Canvas) address is https://q.utoronto.ca . Log in using your UTORid and password.\n\n\nWhat is my UTORid?\nUTORid is your key to a number of University of Toronto services including institutional email and Blackboard courses in the Portal. To obtain a UTORid, you first need to obtain a T-Card (student identification card) from a T-Card office. Your UTORid is printed on the student card. You should also receive a printout from the T-Card office with instructions on how to activate your UTORid.\n \nI tried but I can't log in to Querucs with my UTORid\nYou may not have activated your UTORid and password. If you are a first time UTORid user (both new and returning students) visit www.utorid.utoronto.ca and follow the instructions under “First Time users”.  \nNew students: Click here to Activate your UTORid. You will find reference to a “Secret Activation Key”. This was originally issued to you when you picked up your T-card. If you have lost your “Secret Activation Key” you can visit your campus Help Desk.\n Returning to UofT: If you have been with the University of Toronto for some time, or you are returning to the University and have not created a UTORid, click here to Create your UTORid then follow the instructions.\nRe-type your password; check that the Caps Lock is not on.\n \nWhy can't I see my course card on the Dashboard when I log in to Quercus?\n\nYou should see your course when you first log in to Quercus on your Dashboard, or in the Courses menu item that is located in the Global Navigation Menu on the left side of every page in Quercus. If you do not see your course select All Courses.  See instructions for customizing your course list as a student.\nYour instructor may not have made the course available to students yet – check with your instructor or department first.\nYou may not be registered for the course in the ACORN (formerly ROSI) system – check ACORN or with your Registrar.\nYou may have recently registered for the course on ACORN and your course enrollment is in the process to be sent to Quercus – wait 24 to 48 hours for your registration to be updated in Quercus.\nThe course may not be offered on Quercus this session – check with your department or with your Registrar.\n\n\nHow do I remove a course from appearing on my Dashboard?\nWhen you are enrolled in more than one Quercus course, you can customize the active courses you want to show in your Course list. If you want to remove the default course card setting, you can customize the course list and manually select your favorite courses to display in the Dashboard.  \n \nI want to change my name as it appears in Quercus\n\n\nOfficial Name Change you should contact the Registrar's Office\n\nChange to Preferred First Name: If you are a student who is not employed by the University of Toronto, please go to the Office of the Registrar and request that they change your preferred first name in ACORN/ROSI. It will take 24 - 48 hours for the change to be made. Then go to https://my.auth.utoronto.ca/, select your preferred first name and click \"Set\".\nIf you are a student who is employed by the University of Toronto, you can change your display name in Quercus by going to  https://my.auth.utoronto.ca/, typing in your preferred first name and clicking \"Set\".\n\n\n \nIntroduction and Overview\n1. Watch this overview video for students (created by Canvas, the platform that supports Quercus).\n2. Video: Overview of Quercus for Students created by U of T Mississauga Library Instructional Technology Support Team\nOverview of Quercus for Students\nThis video introduces students to the Quercus environment (via the full web browser version.) It demonstrates:\n\nthe global menu options\nsettings for notifications\nhelp resources and contacting your instructor\nnavigating your course and logging out\n\n \n3. There is also a mobile app for students called Canvas Student to access Quercus\n\n\nMobile App Notifications: We have received reports that push notifications are not being generated on certain mobile devices. The developer for the Canvas Student and Canvas Teacher mobile apps has been notified of this. The Canvas Student app should not be used for any high-risk activities such as submitting assignments or quizzes—important tasks and assessments should be completed on a desktop or laptop computer instead. Troubleshooting Issues: The Canvas Student and Teacher mobile apps are developed by Instructure, Inc., not the University of Toronto. Please be aware that these mobile apps have limited functionality, and the service through these apps are provided \"as-is\". For a more complete experience access your courses using the desktop version.\nMost issues can be resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the app from your mobile device. Additional troubleshooting and questions may have to be directed to your cellular network provider and device manufacturer.\n\n \nFind Your Way Around Quercus\n\nThe Dashboard is the first thing you see when you log into Quercus. Your courses will display as course cards (or course tiles) in alphabetical order by course name.\nTo access a course click on the course name in the course card.\nReview the Accessibility within Canvas (Quercus) guide\nThe Global Navigation menu appears on the left hand-side of every page.\nFrom that menu you can:\n\n\n\n\n\npersonalize your profile\nedit your notifications (see below)\nsee a list of all your courses\naccess the Calendar,\naccess the Inbox and conversations\naccess Help resources.\n\n \nYour Responsibility as a Student for Course Notifications and Email\nMake sure your email address listed in ACORN is a @mail.utoronto.ca address (or a university email address given to you by your department, for example @physics.utoronto.ca). You get a @mail.utoronto.ca address at the same time you activate your UTORid and Password. You can check your U of T email account at http://mail.utoronto.ca/.\nAll course correspondence that is sent using Querucs is sent to a university-issued email address; this is university policy. Due to this policy, in order to receive email from Quercus, you must update ACORN with your official university-issued e-mail address. Until you do this step, you will not be able to receive email sent through Quercus by your instructor.\nNotification Preferences\nStudents have the option of choosing how they receive notifications from the Quercus system by adding their preferred contact method such as SMS text messages on the Settings page. The notification settings will apply to all of your Quercus courses.  Please be advised that students have the right to forward notifications to a non-university, external email provider such as Gmail, Hotmail etc., however this is not recommended. University policy on official correspondence with students states:\n \n\n\n\"Students have the right to forward their University issued electronic mail account to another electronic mail service provider address but remain responsible for ensuring that all University electronic message communication sent to the official University-issued account is received and read.\"\n\n \nOnce contact methods are added, users can set their own Notification Preferences to select how often they want to be notified of course events.\nStudents choose when notifications will be sent to them by selecting the appropriate icon:\n\nDaily summaries are typically sent around 6pm. Weekly summaries are typically sent on Saturdays around 6pm.\n \nView Grades\nThe Grades page displays all current grades for course assignments. The instructor chooses to display or not display this page to students.  If you do not see the Grades option in your course menu contact your instructor.\n\n\nStudents should understand that grades posted in their Quercus course allows them early access to preliminary grades, it does not represent their official final marks. Official course grades are posted on ACORN.\n\n \nView Calendar\nThe calendar tool provides students with course related information and activities, and keep track of course events. Watch a video on the calendar tool for students.\n \nResources for Quercus (Canvas)\n\nStudent Quercus Support Resources\n\nU of T Quercus for Students Blog SitePosts are written by students for students who share their experiences and tips when using the Quercus academic toolbox\n\nKey Resources Student Guide: curated links to key resources from the Canvas Community website to get you started with using Quercus\nWhat are the basic computer requirements?\nSupport Browsers\n\n \nSelf-Paced Videos\n \nLynda.com\n\n\nLynda.com on-demand courses\n\nLearning Canvas 2018 course\nCanvas: Tips, Tricks, & Techniques course\n\n\n\n \nCanvas Community Videos for Students (offered by Instructure) \nLearn at your own pace and on your own schedule.

Users with the MacOS Sierra or MacOS High Sierra, may experience an issue when attempting to run the iClicker Classic program. While iClicker is currently researching a solution to this issue, a fix is not expected in the near future. For more information please see Known Issue: iClicker issue with Sierra and High Sierra OS.\n\n \nOverview\niClicker is an optional integration in Quercus. If you would like to use iClickers with your class(es) you will need to add it to the left side menu. See step-by-step instructions below.\niClicker (commonly called “clickers”) is the name for the classroom response system currently supported at the U of T.   Additional information from U of T's Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation on approaches for using iClickers in your class.\niClicker's Canvas Integration allows for data to be transferred between Quercus (powered by Canvas) and iClicker’s gradebook. This enables students to register their iClicker remotes directly within their Quercus course.  In addition, it allows you to easily download your class roster and student registrations from Quercus. You will also be able to easily upload your iClicker session data into their Quercus Gradebook. The iClicker integration allows students to register their clickers through their Quercus course(s) which means all data will be synced with their UTORid. It also allows students who have purchased used iClicker remotes to avoid the possibility of a \"used remote registration fee\" that may be applied if they register on the iClicker website rather than when from within their Quercus course.\n \n\nStep-by-step instructions\nInstructors using iClickers are encouraged to enable the iClicker integration tool in their Quercus courses. \nThe iClicker app is already installed. The link simply needs to be made visible  to students by following the steps below.\n \n\nAdding an iClicker Registration Link for Students\n1. Add a link to iClicker device registration in your course menu, by following these steps:\na) In your course menu, click \"Settings.\"\nb) Click on the \"Navigation\" tab.\nd) Drag \"iClicker registration\" up from the list of hidden navigation items to the list of visible navigation items in the top half of this list.\ne) Save your change.\n2. After iClicker is added to the course menu, students will be able to register their devices by selecting the first link, and following the instructions.\nImportant note:When you as an instructor (or a TA) click on the \"i>clicker registration\" link you will see three options, as shown below, but you do not need to click on any of those links, you will control your iClicker activities through the iClicker application (instructions in the \"Sync iClicker grades with Quercus gradebook below). U of T is using the \"iClicker Classic v7\" application and not the version that the links point to in the page shown when an Instructor/TA clicks the \"i>clicker registration\" link. When students click the \"i>clicker registration\" it takes them directly into the registration process so this caution only applies to instructors or TAs.\n \n\nSync iClicker grades with Quercus Gradebook \nIf instructors want the grades from iClicker assessments to appear in their Quercus course, they must install the iClicker Classic software application that is customized for U of T's Quercus. This application will also allow instructors to control your iClicker activities in class.\n1. Download the appropriate zip files below for the \"U of T Customized iClicker Classic software\" \nUT iClicker classic for Mac\nUT iClicker classic for Windows\n2. Expand/extract the files\n3. Run the application on the computer you'll be using to lead iClicker activities (when you run the iClicker installation it will recognize that you are using Canvas.)\n4. When you open iClicker, you will see the Welcome Screen with no courses listed. Click the \"+ Create\" button to add your course. \n5. The \"Create New Course\" window appears. Enter your Course Name. This name does not need to match the class name in Quercus. Click \"Create\".\n 6. Select your course name from the course list and click \"Settings.\"\n7. A window will open, click on the \"Gradebook\" tab along the top of this window.\n8. Next to \"LMS Name:\" it should list Quercus, click Select course\n\n 9. Then a pop-up window will prompt you to log in with your UTORid and password. Then click \"Authorize\" to continue.\n10. From the list of courses that appear, select the course you want to sync with iClicker, then click \"Select\"\nNOTE:  The course selection window displays the master course along with any sections under the master. If you select the master course (without any section distinctions) this will pull the entire roster for all sections.If you select one of the sections will only pull the roster for that particular section.\n11. The course that you selected should now appear following \"LMS course\" as seen below:\n\n12. For more information about the optional settings, such as \"Sync remote registrations from LMS only\" and \"Change the way zeros and absences are uploaded to Canvas\", please see this iClicker page.\n\n16. Close this Course Settings window to return to the view as follows and select \"Open Gradebook\" \n\n17. Then click \"Sync Roster.\"\n\n18. You will be asked to log in with your UTORid, then student names should populate from your course.\nFor additional information, please see these iClicker support pages.\n "},{"title":"Discussions","slug":"discussions","lastUpdated":"2018-09-19T19:06:04Z","published":true,"url":"https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/discussions","body":"Discussions are areas where students can contribute content to the course. \n \n\n\nStudent file attachments for non-graded Discussions are counted towards their personal quota.

Introduction: Two Methods of Presenting Course Content\nCourse content can be presented in two ways: Modules and Pages. Modules are a way to  organize  course content. Pages give flexibility on how to display course content. Modules can link to Pages, and Pages can link to Modules.\n\n\nAdditional Resource: Video giving an overview of the modules and pages approach in Canvas.\n\n \n2. Organizing your Course into Modules\nModules allow instructors to determine the order and structure (eg. by week, unit, or topic) in which the content will be released to the end-user to provide a guided learning experience. Why use modules?  Organization. Allows the students to move through the course in a predetermined order set by the instructor. Prerequisites.  Help students avoid missing course content or assignments by setting completion prerequisites. Monitor Progress.  Help both the instructor and students monitor their progression through course content.\n\n\n\nOpen Modules: In Course Navigation, select the Modules link.\n\n\n\nAdd a new Module: Select the + Module button.\n\n\n\nAdd Module name: Type a name in the Module Name field.\n\nLock Module date: If you want to restrict the module until a specific date, you can lock the module.\n\n\nAdd Module prerequisites: If you have added at least one module to your course, you can require a prerequisite module. A prerequisite module means students must complete the previous modules before they can view the new module.\n\nAdd Module: Select the Add Module button.\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Adding Items to your Module and Publishing Modules\nYou can add new or existing content items in Quercus to a module. You can also add an item to multiple modules, or multiple iterations of an item to one module\n\n\n\nOpen Modules: In Course Navigation, select the Modules link. \n\n\nAdd Module item: Click the Add Item (+) button. \n\n\nAdd new item: From the Add drop-down menu and select one of the following item types: • Assignment• Quiz• File (document and media file types)• Content Page• Discussion• External URL• External Tool\n\n\n\nAdd existing item: If you have already created the item you want to add, click the name of the item. You can select more than one item to add.\n\nAdd new item: If you want to add a new item, click the New link and type a name in the name field. Depending on the item type, when adding new content you may be asked to complete additional fields.\n\nIndent item: Choose the Indentation drop-down menu to indent the item inside of the module.\n\nAdd item: Click on the Add Item button.\n\n\nView Module item: From the side menu click on Modules.\n\nPublish Module item: Click on Publish button to make it visible to students.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Building and Publishing Pages in Your Course\nPages allow instructors to display a smaller amount of information, for example, a specific topic. Having a similar feel to a webpage, Pages are multimodal and can display text, embedded videos, images and files, all in one scrollable area.\nWhy use pages?Context.  Help students understand what they should focus on and what they should be learning. Multimodal.  Readings, links, images, videos and more, can be placed in one area for a complete lesson.\n\n\n\nOpen Pages: In Course Navigation, select the Pages link. \n\n\nView Pages: Pages is designed to open to the front page for the course, if there is a front page selected.

It appears as an option when creating an Assignment (as outlined in the step-by-step instructions below).\nOverview\nThe peerScholar peer assessment tool enables students to provide constructive feedback on each others' work and facilitates critical reflection on how they might improve their own work. peerScholar targets meta-cognitive thought processes, even in very large class contexts. Developed by Professor Steve Joordens and Dwayne Pare at the University of Toronto Scarborough, the tool is designed to allow students to think critically and creatively, to be analytic, and to communicate their thoughts clearly through peer assessment. peerScholar is available for use in Quercus courses.\nImportant note about grading and peerScholar:At U of T, Instructors or TAs, rather than students, must provide the final grades on peerScholar assignments.\nThese final grades may be informed by peer feedback and must be interpreted by an expert grader in combination with other pedagogical factors that are relevant (e.g., the quality of peer comments, etc). This approach allows the evidence-based pedagogical benefits of peer-assessment to be harnessed in a way that is consistent with current institutional labour practices.\n \n\nStep-by-Step Instructions\npeerScholar assignments are created by selecting the option for peerScholar when you create an assignment in your Quercus course.\n1. Select Assignments from the left side menu and the \"+ Assignment\" button at top right OR  if creating this from within a module, select the the \"+\" button (and select Assignment> [New Assignment])\n2.

This includes the option to have Quercus send course communications directly to their University email account inbox. Notifications can be enabled for many activities including new student submissions, assignment grades available, or new Inbox conversation messages.\nEmail notifications are generated from the address notifications@instructure.com.\nPlease note that your notification preferences only apply to your profile.\nCustomizing Notifications\nInstructions on how to adjust notification preferences are the same for students, instructors, and course staff.\nFor a more in-depth understanding of notifications and their triggers, please refer to the Canvas Notifications PDF.\nStudent Responsibility and Course Communications\n\n\nStudents should login to Quercus (https://q.utoronto.ca) and reply to course messages using the communication tools in Quercus.\nAs part of university policy, students are required to ensure that all Quercus communications are sent to their official university-issued email address. Students should reply to course messages and Quercus notifications using the Inbox tool.\n\nAll of Quercus' correspondence is sent to a university-issued e-mail address; this is university policy. Due to this policy, in order to receive email from Quercus, students must update ACORN, U of T's student information service, with their official university-issued e-mail address. \nWhile the policy does not preclude forwarding University e-mails to an external provider such as Gmail, Hotmail etc., this is not recommended. Forwarding is appreciably less reliable than direct delivery, and special attention should be paid to the section of the policy that states:\n\"Students have the right to forward their University issued electronic mail account to another electronic mail service provider address but remain responsible for ensuring that all University electronic message communication sent to the official University-issued account is received and read.\"\nAll communication via Quercus is sent to an university-issued email address by default, as defined in ACORN, U of T's student information service. Users have the ability to customize their notification preferences and contact methods, however it is university policy that students are responsible for receiving and reading messages in their institutional email account. From the policy:\n\"Students have the right to forward their University issued electronic mail account to another electronic mail service provider address but remain responsible for ensuring that all University electronic message communication sent to the official University-issued account is received and read.\"\nAdditional Contact Methods\nIt is always recommended to set the institutional University of Toronto email address as the main, default address. However, users have the option of adding additional email address or install the Canvas Student Mobile App. These instructions are the same for students, instructors, and course staff.\n "},{"title":"Mobile Apps","slug":"mobile-apps","lastUpdated":"2018-10-19T22:53:39Z","published":true,"url":"https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/mobile-apps","body":"On This Page\n\nCanvas Teacher\nCanvas Student\nBlackboard Collaborate Ultra\nTechSmith Fuse\n\n \n\n\nMobile App Notifications: We have received reports that push notifications are not being generated on certain mobile devices.

Assignments can also be created to add columns in the Gradebook to enter grades for no-submission activities such as participation. \nAssignments can be assigned to individual students, groups, or sections.\nWhen creating an assignment you could choose one of the following submission options:\n\n\nNo Submission: Create a column in the Gradebook to give students a grade for participation in an activity or event that does not require any form of submission.\n\nOnline: Collect online submissions from students in the form of uploaded files, Website URLs (e.g. blogs), Media recordings, or text entry.\n\nOn Paper: Give students a grade for something turned in during class (a project, printed essay, presentation, etc.).\n\nExternal Tool: When you want students to submit their assignments using an integrated tool. (e.g. peerScholar)\n\n\nSubmission Type does not apply to Not Graded assignments.\nYou can create assignments on the Assignments page. Once the Assignment is created, you can add details for the assignment such as the description, file submission types, due date and point value.\n \nGradebook\nFor graded assignments, you can view and enter grades for students in the Gradebook. You can also use SpeedGrader to view, comment, and grade student submissions directly within the browser.

Instructors, TAs and Graders who would like assistance with this should contact their divisional support representative.\n \nPlagiarism Detection (Turnitin)\n\n\nBEFORE creating a Turnitin Assignment instructors must adhere to the University of Toronto Conditions of Use and inform their students at the start of the course that Turnitin will be used for coursework. Instructors must include the Conditions of Use statement in their course syllabus.\nUnmuted assignments, via the Gradebook, enable students to view Turnitin Similarity Reports.\n\nTurnitin is a tool that will assist in detecting textual similarities between compared works. Turnitin is an integrated tool/option in Quercus. It appears as an option when creating an online Assignment. \nWith the Turnitin integration in Quercus courses, class and assignment setup using the Turnitin.com website is not supported at U of T.\n \nQuizzes\nUse quizzes to create a variety of question types to test your students' learning in an exam format. There are also options to create formative and self-assessments by creating practice quizzes and surveys. There are four types of quizzes available in Quercus:\n\n\nGraded Quiz: A column is automatically created in the Gradebook for a graded quiz. After a student takes a graded quiz, certain question types will be automatically graded.\n\nPractice Quiz: Use practice quiz as a learning tool to help students see how well they understand the course material. Students do not receive a grade for practice quizzes, even though the quiz results display the number of points earned in the quiz. \nGraded Survey: A graded survey allows the instructor to give students points for completing the survey, but it does not allow the survey to be graded for right or wrong answers. Graded surveys have the option to be anonymous.\n\nUngraded Surveys: An ungraded survey allows you to get opinions or other information from your students, but students do not receive a grade for their responses. Ungraded surveys can be anonymous. \n\n\nYou can view all your quizzes in your course on the Quizzes page. You can also add quizzes and modify quiz settings on the Quizzes page.\n\nIn order to create a new Quiz, click the Add Quiz button.\n\nWhen you create a quiz, you have a variety of options to choose from within a quiz. Once you have set up the settings for your quiz, click the Questions tab to create the quiz questions and points. You can create individual quiz questions, or find questions in a question bank. You can also create a question group to randomize quiz questions. \nIndividual questions can be added to a Question Group. Alternatively, you can link the Question Group to a Question Bank.\n\nYou can view student quiz results within each quiz in your course by viewing the quiz results page or moderating the quiz.\n \nPeer Review and Assessment (peerScholar)\nThe peerScholar peer assessment tool enables students to provide constructive feedback on each others' work and facilitates critical reflection on how they might improve their own work. peerScholar targets meta-cognitive thought processes, even in very large class contexts.\npeerScholar is an integrated tool/option in Quercus. It appears as an option when creating an Assignment.\n \nRubrics\nRubrics can be used for increasing grading efficiency, improving students’ understanding of expectations, and monitoring performance. Once you create a rubric, the rubric is saved in your course for future use. You can add the rubric to a graded Discussion, a Quiz, or an Assignment and use the rubric to grade submissions in SpeedGrader.\nCreated rubrics can be managed in the Manage Rubrics page.\n "},{"title":"Example Courses","slug":"example-courses","lastUpdated":"2018-07-20T17:39:47Z","published":true,"url":"https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/example-courses","body":"In order to give individuals creating courses in Quercus some ideas for what can be created in Quercus the following public sites have been provided as examples.

Please check here regularly for updates, and if you have any questions or concerns, or notice any other issues, please contact your divisional educational technologist or write to q.help@utoronto.ca. Thanks.\n___________________________________\nLetter Grades\nAdvisory: Caution should be exercised when using Letter Grades\nWe have identified a number of potential issues regarding the use of letter grades in Quercus. Problems can occur when using Gradebook or the online assignment grading tool, SpeedGrader. It is recommended that instructors and Teaching Assistants do not enter letter grades in Gradebook or SpeedGrader, unless they follow the steps in the support document (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/letter-grades). This document outlines the issues and provides important and clear instructions on how to mitigate and work around them. Our software partner, Instructure, is aware of the concerns and is seeking to address them in a future upgrade. If you have any questions, please contact your divisional support team (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/support#support-contacts) for this or any other Quercus matters.\n___________________________________\nRich Media Files and Quercus\nAdvisory: Please don't store large quantities of videos and photographs on Quercus\nMany instructors use rich media files (videos and pictures) as part of their teaching. Quercus does have some capacity to locally host such files (up to 3 gigabytes per course), however, Quercus should not serve as a media repository, because it is a specialized application suite and not a cost-affordable storage service. Luckily, U of T provides a variety of services that are meant explicitly for media, and we are actively looking at other solutions as well. To read more about those services, please visit Quercus Support https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/rich-media-files-videos-and-pictures.\n___________________________________\nThe Module Tool\nAdvisory: Don't forget to make the Modules Tool available in your course settings.\nSome instructors have been setting up Modules in the courses (we expect this to be quite a common design choice). They can do so by clicking on the Modules link in their course navigation menu. Once they create a Module, they can choose when to make it available to students. However, by default, the whole Modules tool is hidden to students. That means that an instructor who has clicked an individual module to make it available may still need to make the whole tool visible in the course navigation menu before students are able to view and access content. In the course menu, click on SETTINGS, then chose the NAVIGATION tab. Drag the Modules tool entry from the lower \"hidden\" box to the upper \"menu\" box, click save at the bottom of the page, and the Modules tool is now visible to students. For more on using Modules, please see https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/modules-and-pages  or contact your local support professional https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/support#support-contacts.\n___________________________________\nThe People ToolAdvisory: Recommend not using the People tool unless specifically needed\nThe People tool is useful for instructors and course administrators who are managing their courses. The tool is available to instructors even when it is greyed out (i.e. not available for students to use). While it is fine for students in a course to know one another, it is generally advisable to keep the People tool off for students unless it is explicitly needed as part of your course design (for example, if you want to use self-sign up groups, you will need to turn on your People tool). For more specific advice on the use of the People tool in your course, please contact your divisional educational technologist.\n___________________________________\nGroups for Administrative Purposes\nAdvisory: Consult with your divisional support professional before using Groups for administrative purposes\nInstructors that make use of either the native Quercus group tool or UT Advanced Group tool for administrative purposes (rather than for teaching purposes) should know that students will be aware that they are members of a group. If instructors don’t want students to be aware of administrative groups, there is a work-around that may be appropriate. Please contact your divisional educational technologist for support.\n___________________________________\nAnonymous Surveys in Quercus aren't Really Anonymous\nAdvisory: Recommend not using the Quercus Survey tool for anything that requires anonymity\nThe native survey tool in Quercus has an option to create an anonymous survey. However, after respondents take the survey, the instructor could change the settings, revealing the respondents identity. This is a known issue with the underlying Canvas software, which many schools have reported to the company. There is no timeline for a fix. Until they do fix it, if you really need to run an anonymous survey, please use a different tool. For example, all instructors have access to the Microsoft Forms tool, which is a simple survey tool with an anonymous capability: http://office365.utoronto.ca/about/forms/ \n___________________________________\nAdvice on Using the Inbox/Conversations Tool\nAdvisory: Always use the ‘Send Individual Messages’ options\nInstructors can use the Quercus Inbox tool to send internal messages to students (also known as the Conversations tool). When they do so, students receive a notice in their regular email that they have received a Quercus message (not unlike a notice they may receive from Facebook or Twitter). While the Inbox/Conversations tool may give the instructor the impression that tool behaves like regular email, it is much more limited (see early Quirk below). Instructors are advised to use a tool like Announcements to post important information for the whole class. If, however, an instructor does wish to use Inbox/Conversations tool, we strongly advise them to check off the box that says \"Send an individual message to each recipient\" which is akin to using the BCC field in email. Failure to do so will mean that all students will see all other students' names in the notification they receive. We have reported this as a flaw to the company.\n___________________________________\nNative Quercus Syllabus Tool\nAdvisory: Avoid Use of the Native Syllabus Tool\nThe native Syllabus tool in Quercus is not really a Syllabus - it is, at best, a site index for the course shell, automatically generated when an instructor populates their course shell with various activities. As such, we strongly recommend that instructors not enable this tool at all. A proper copy of the syllabus should be uploaded as content and featured prominently in the course, rather than using the native tool. \n___________________________________\nReplies sent by email to a notification are not delivered\nAdvisory: Inform students not send you official correspondence by replying to forwarded notifications\nCertain Instructor actions generate a courtesy email notification that is sent to students (for example, if the Instructor posts an announcement). In theory, a student could hit \"reply\" in their personal email, but replies sent by email to a notification are not delivered. Neither the email sender, nor the intended recipient, will be notified of the email delivery failure. All users (students, instructors and teaching assistants) should reply to notification email messages by logging into Quercus (not unlike other systems, such as Facebook Messenger). A line reminding students about this is automatically added to the bottom of any such notification that a student receives via email. Read more about this and related support on our Notifications support page."},{"title":"Groups","slug":"groups","lastUpdated":"2018-10-05T13:03:58Z","published":true,"url":"https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/groups","body":"Organizing the students in your Quercus course into a Group Set allows you to administer group work and facilitate communication to and between the group members.

You can also limit the number of members who can sign up for each group.\nStudents can join self sign-up groups through the People page.\n \nGroup Assignments\nOnce groups are created in your course, you can create group assignments to allow students to collaboratively work in teams. With group assignments, only one student in the group has to submit the assignment.\n \nGrade Group Assignments\n\n\nOnline Submissions\nFor online submitted files through Quercus, you can grade group assignments via SpeedGrader. When grading the assignment in SpeedGrader, it will show the Group names instead of the student names. Once you give the group a grade, everyone in that group will see the grade and the comments.\n\nGrades are typically assigned to the entire group, but you can choose to assign grades to students individually.\n\n\nAdjust Grade for Individual Group Members\nAfter assigning grades to the entire group, you can change the grade for individuals in the group by editing the assignment’s settings:\n\nclick on the assignment\nClick the Edit button\nCheck the box for Assign Grades to Each Student Individually\n\n\nClick Save\n\nClick on Grades on the course menu.\nAdjust the scores for individuals in the group\n\n\n\n\nOffline Submissions\nTo grade No Submission or On Paper group assignments, click the Grades on the course menu and enter a score for one member in the group.  It will be copied to the other group members.\n\n\n \nGroup Discussions\nIf you have a big class, it might be helpful to break your discussions into groups to have more intimate or group-specific discussions. To create a group discussion, you set up the discussion topic once, but it appears in multiple separate groups. Only the members of the group will see and respond to their group's post.\n \n\nUT Advanced Group Tool\nThe UT Advanced Group Tool allows course staff to perform a variety of advanced tasks such as create Groups from baseline rosters, create Sections from Groups, and batch enroll students into Groups.\n \nIn This Section\n\nAccess the Tool \nCreate Baseline Group Sets\nUpdate Baseline Group Sets\nRemove All Group Members\nClone Groups into Sections\nUpdate or Delete Sections Created From Groups\nImport Group Rosters\nExport Group Rosters\n\n \nAccess the Tool\nThe UT Advanced Group Tool is available for all Quercus courses and is only accessible to course staff (Teacher, TA, Course Staff, Grader, Designer, and Librarian).

Crowdmark workflow provides efficiency gains in exam administration, grading, data recording and analysis, returning exams and handling regrade requests, and data visualizations of student performance.\nHow does Crowdmark work with Quercus (Canvas)?\n \nAvailability\nThe University of Toronto currently has an agreement with Crowdmark that will make the tool interact with Quercus.  \nEach division of the University has its own policies and practices regarding access to, use of, and support of Crowdmark. These practices and policies may relate to the financial management of the tool (there is a per-student-per-course licensing cost borne by each division), or they may relate to policies on how exams are managed within a particular department.\nTherefore, the Crowdmark tool is not universally available by default. Every request for access to the tool, on a course-by-course basis, renewed each semester, must be approved by the relevant division.\n \nContact the Divisional Representative to Enable Crowdmark in Your Course\n\n\nCrowdmark will enable the use of the tool in consultation with the divisional representative, not individual instructors. \n\n \nAny instructor who wishes to use Crowdmark should make a request to their relevant divisional representative, or they can send an email to q.help@utoronto.ca to identify their divisional contact.\nAs per our workflow, the Quercus Help support team will forward the instructor on to the relevant divisional representative. The instructor will discuss the policies and practices with the divisional representative. If the use of Crowdmark is approved, the divisional representative will contact Crowdmark with the course ID and Crowdmark will enable use of the tool for the Quercus course. Once the divisional representative receives confirmation from Crowdmark, they should send an email to the Quercus Help team to let them know at q.help@utoronto.ca that Crowdmark has been enabled.\n \nGetting Started \nAccess to Crowdmark\nVia the Crowdmark website - https://app.crowdmark.com/sign-in/utoronto. \nSigning into Crowdmark\nWhen signing into Crowdmark instructors will be asked to sign in through U of T's institutional sign in page and to provide Crowdmark with access to their Quercus (Canvas) account.  This will allow Crowdmark to gather student and staff team enrollments and to export grades back to Quercus.\nHow do students access Crowdmark?\nStudents can sign in to Crowdmark in their Quercus course or with an email and password here: https://app.crowdmark.com/sign-in.

The ACTion Journal, a journal showcasing the effective use of academic and collaborative technologies at the University of Toronto, may also be consulted for innovative approaches to teaching with lecture capture software.\n \nFaculty Profile\nTeaching and Technology: Usability Testing Using Lecture Capture Software\nWhile lecture capture can be used to capture lecture sessions and the on-screen display of a computer or laptop, Colin Furness, an instructor for INF1005/6 - Usability Assessment Workshop, from the Faculty of Information, used Lecture Capture software as a requirement for a student assignment.  The assignment required students to perform usability testing by capturing users' interactions with online systems, to help identify issues and make recommendations. Students worked together to design tests, interpret results and reflect on the meaning of users' recorded on-screen interactions. Their recordings and recommendations were then submitted to the instructor for assessment. This assignment helped students develop their collaboration skills while learning about usability testing in a hands-on fashion.\n\n \n\nDownload and Install TechSmith Relay\n\nVisit the TechSmith Relay Dashboard.\nLog in with your UTORid and password.\nSelect Client Downloads in the panel on the right or from the menu bar at the top.\n\nSelect the appropriate download based on your operating system.Note: The TechSmith Fuse Mobile Recorders are available through their respective online stores.Note: The TechSmith Relay Portable Recorder can be installed on a USB flash drive.\n\nOpen the installer and follow the steps as shown.\n\n \nRecord a Session\n\nLaunch the TechSmith Relay Recorder software.\nLog in with your UTORid and password when prompted, or select the Log In button at the top left.Note: If you forget to log in, you will be prompted once you submit your recording.\n\nTo record your webcam in addition to your screen, select Camera at the top.\n\nIn the Presentation Details section, enter a title and description for your recording.\n\nIf this is your first time using TechSmith Relay, select the Test button to record a short, 10 second video as a test. This will allow you to confirm that your audio is working correctly and give you a feel for how the recorder works.\nWhen you are ready, select the red Rec button to start the recording. A 3 second countdown will lead you into the recording.Note: If you are using a projector or multiple displays, you may be asked to choose which display to record.\n\nWhen you are finished, select the Stop button. If the recording window is not visible, right click on the TechSmith Relay icon in the System Tray (Windows) or Dock (Mac), and then select Stop.\n\nWhat while your recording is finalized. This may take a while depending on the length of your recording.\nOnce that process is complete, you will be given the option to trim the beginning and/or end of the recording, as well as update the presentation details.\n\nSelect Submit to upload the recording to MyMedia.Note: No progress bar willb e shown. If your Internet connection is interrupted during the upload, it will automatically resume the next time your connection is restored.\nYou will receive an email from MyMedia once your recording has been processed and is ready for viewing and sharing.\n\n \nShare a Recording\n\nOnce the recording is ready, you will receive an email from MyMedia.\nSelect the link provided in the email.\nLog in to MyMedia with your UTORid and password.\nYou will now be able to:\n\nUpdate the title and description of the video\nSet access restrictions - whether the video is accessible to the public or only members of U of T\nAllow the video to be downloaded or only viewed online\n\n\nSelect Save to complete the process.\nOn the following page, you will be presented with three options to share your video:\n\nPermanent Play Link - a link to a web page that plays the video\nMedia Download Link - a link that will download the video\nEmbed Code - HTML code for embedding the video and playing it on a different website\n\n\n\nAdditional information about MyMedia and the services it offers can be found on their help page.\n \nTroubleshooting\nMissing recordings or not receiving the MyMedia email\nThere are a couple reasons why your video may not have completed properly and you have not received the email from MyMedia allowing you to finish the process and view your recording.\nThe first potential problem is that the video has not finished uploading from the computer you used to record it. For example if a laptop was used to record a presentation and was then shutdown shortly afterwards, the recording would not have completed uploading. In this case you will need to turn on the laptop and connect it to the Internet to allow the recording to resume uploading.\nThe second problem is if you did not log in when starting your recording, selected Guest, or chose the \"Upload and Decide Later\" profile. When any of these options are chosen, the recording will be uploaded to the server but the processing will not be able to finish. To resolve this, log into the TechSmith Relay Dashboard and check for any recordings that are waiting to be processed.\n \nQuota limits for video recordings\nThere are no size limits on the videos uploaded to TechSmith Relay and MyMedia. Faculty and staff are able to upload an unlimited number of videos, however students are limited to 40 videos on MyMedia."},{"title":"Integrated Tools","slug":"integrated-tools","lastUpdated":"2018-10-23T00:13:22Z","published":true,"url":"https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/integrated-tools","body":"Quercus Academic Toolbox Integrated Tools from A-Z\nThe integration of learning tools in the academic toolbox extends functionality and allows instructors to choose the tools that match their course goals and learning outcomes.

Quercus does have some capacity to locally host such files (up to 3 gigabytes per course), however, Quercus should not serve as a media repository, because it is a specialized application suite and not a cost-affordable storage service.\nLuckily, U of T provides a variety of services that are meant explicitly for media, and we are actively looking at other solutions as well.\n \nRich Media Services\nFADIS\nThe Federated Academic Digital Imaging System (FADIS) from U of T Libraries was originally designed to house high-resolution art and architecture images, but has expanded to serve all disciples. Images loaded into FADIS can be linked to from a Quercus course. Please visit FADIS for more information.\nMyMedia\nMyMedia, also from U of T Libraries, is an archival storage and streaming solution that provides an interface for uploading a wide array of video and audio file formats and for managing and sharing your media. It can be linked to from a Quercus course. Please visit MyMedia for more information.\nTSpace\nA third option may be TSpace, a free and secure research repository established by University of Toronto Libraries to disseminate and preserve the scholarly record of the University of Toronto community. Instructors may have already curated an integrated collection that includes multi-media components, and can use TSpace to make that collection available to their students. Again, a TSpace collection can be linked to from a Quercus course.
