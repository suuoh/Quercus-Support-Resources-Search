The Assignments page in your Quercus course menu will display several forms of assessment in one location. The items automatically displayed in the Assignments tab include: Any graded & ungraded assignments you create Any graded quizzes or graded discussions you create, even if you create those items in other parts of your course (e.g. from the calendar, quizzes tab, discussions tab, or from within Modules). Assignments Assignments can be created to collect student work online (or on paper) and provide students with grades and feedback. Assignments can also be created to add columns in the Gradebook to enter grades for no-submission activities such as participation. Assignments can be assigned to individual students, groups, or sections. When creating an assignment you could choose one of the following submission options: No Submission: Create a column in the Gradebook to give students a grade for participation in an activity or event that does not require any form of submission. Online: Collect online submissions from students in the form of uploaded files, Website URLs (e.g. blogs), Media Recordings, or Text Entry. If the Media Recordings submission type has been selected for assignment submissions, they do not count against user or course quota. To learn more about available options for using media files in Quercus (Canvas), view the Canvas Media Comparison PDF. On Paper: Give students a grade for something turned in during class (a project, printed essay, presentation, etc.). External Tool: When you want students to submit their assignments using an integrated tool. (e.g. peerScholar) Submission Type does not apply to Not Graded assignments. You can create assignments on the Assignments page. Once the Assignment is created, you can add details for the assignment such as the description, file submission types, due date and point value. Review the assignment to ensure all elements are in finalized form before publishing. Microsoft Office 365 Assignments Instructors can also use the Office 365 integration to create Office 365 assignments. Gradebook The New Gradebook, activated in May 2019, has various changes and improvements. The New Gradebook Instructor Guide provides steps on grading, organizing, and managing the Gradebook and resources and support. For graded assignments, instructors can view and enter grades for students in the Gradebook. Visit our New Gradebook Information page. SpeedGrader Instructors can also use SpeedGrader to view, comment, and grade student submissions directly within the browser. Learn how to get to SpeedGrader from the New Gradebook. Anonymous Moderated Marking Audit Trail for Assignment Submissions The SpeedGrader can display an audit log that records all changes that affect an assignment submission. This allows instructors to verify how grades were awarded and how changes were made. After an assignment has been unmuted, the instructor can access the assessment audit link in SpeedGrader. The link displays the student’s grade and when it was graded. Instructors should review the steps for auditing an assessment in the SpeedGrader. Moderated grading: the window displays when the grade was posted to the student. Non-moderated assignments: the grade represents the last time a grade was applied. The window will display if anonymity was turned on and the effective date and time. Anonymous Assignments: then the window displays the Anonymous On status.If the assignment is only moderated and not anonymous, the window displays the Anonymous Off status. The sidebar displays graders and final graders as well as any admins that have interacted with the assignment or a submission. Users are ordered by role: Student, Grader, Final Grader, Admin. Instructors can view the auditing trail for the assignment and submission by clicking on the name of the user. The start date and time of the audit trail displays at the top of the event list, which may include the following events: assignment created, submission created, assignment settings, anonymity status, grade postings, and muted status. Icons display next to each event to represent each action (e.g., edit, anonymous turned on, anonymous muted). Submission comment events and DocViewer comment events also display, with comment text truncated at 2 lines. To manage releasing grades, you can select a Grade Posting Policy for the course or for individual assignments and temporarily hide assignment grades and feedback. Note about Quercus (Canvas) System Performance: In large courses, SpeedGrader loading times are affected by a threshold of data points that can be loaded within a 60-second window. This threshold is based on a single submission per student. Multiple submissions by the same student increases the submission threshold. Assignments with more than 1,500 submissions may result in delayed SpeedGrader loading times, and assignments with more than 2,500 submissions may fail to load at all. Important Information about Letter Grades in Quercus Important information about letter grades in Quercus (October, 2018) Last name, First name as Separate Cells The option to separate data by last name and first name can be achieved using Microsoft Excel. Instructors, TAs and Graders who would like assistance with this should contact their divisional support representative. CSV column headings Learn more about the CSV column headings for grades and scores and what they mean in your grading process. Plagiarism Detection (Turnitin) BEFORE creating a Turnitin Assignment instructors must adhere to the University of Toronto Conditions of Use and inform their students at the start of the course that Turnitin will be used for coursework. Instructors must include the Conditions of Use statement in their course syllabus. Assignments for which grades have been released (posted), via the Gradebook, enable students to view Turnitin Similarity Reports. Turnitin is a tool that will assist in detecting textual similarities between compared works. Turnitin is an integrated tool/option in Quercus. It appears as an option when creating an online Assignment. With the Turnitin integration in Quercus courses, class and assignment setup using the Turnitin.com website is not supported at U of T. Quizzes There are two quiz options available in Quercus: Classic Quizzes, and New Quizzes Instructors should use Classic Quizzes to deliver mid-terms and final examinations. Some features that are available in Classic Quizzes are not available in New Quizzes. Surveys New Quizzes does not have an option to create surveys, either graded and ungraded. Rich Content Editor The New Quizzes Rich Content Editor for authoring questions and submitting responses to short answer/essay questions does NOT include: Content Selector Sidebar, Accessibility Checker, HTML Editor, or Media Recorder. Assessment Reports The Student Analysis Report is currently not available in New Quizzes. Available New Quizzes reports may take up to 24 hours to generate and can only be viewed in the Reports page. They are not available for downloading as CSV files. Classic Quizzes Use Classic Quizzes to create a variety of question types to test your students' learning in an exam format. There are also options to create formative and self-assessments by creating practice quizzes and surveys. There are four types of quizzes available in Quercus: Graded Quiz: A column is automatically created in the Gradebook for a graded quiz. After a student takes a graded quiz, certain question types will be automatically graded. Practice Quiz: Use practice quiz as a learning tool to help students see how well they understand the course material. Students do not receive a grade for practice quizzes, even though the quiz results display the number of points earned in the quiz. Graded Survey: A graded survey allows the instructor to give students points for completing the survey, but it does not allow the survey to be graded for right or wrong answers. Graded surveys have the option to be anonymous. Ungraded Surveys: An ungraded survey allows you to get opinions or other information from your students, but students do not receive a grade for their responses. Ungraded surveys can be anonymous. You can view all your quizzes in your course on the Quizzes page. You can also add quizzes and modify quiz settings on the Quizzes page. In order to create a new Quiz, click the Add Quiz button. When you create a quiz, you have a variety of options to choose from within a quiz. In the Details tab, you can use the Rich Content Editor to add instructions for your quiz. The Office 365 integration displays the OneDrive icon in the Rich Content Editor in Quizzes and allows users to create a hyperlink to OneDrive files directly in the Rich Content Editor. You can also add links, files , and images to the Quiz instructions using the content selector. Once you have set up the settings for your quiz, click the Questions tab to create the quiz questions and points. You can create individual quiz questions, or find questions in a question bank. You can also create a question group to randomize quiz questions. Individual questions can be added to a Question Group. Alternatively, you can link the Question Group to a Question Bank. You can view student quiz results within each quiz in your course by viewing the quiz results page or moderating the quiz. When moderating the quiz, you can view the progress of student submissions and view the number of quiz attempts each has taken. You can also grant students extra attempts, grant extra time for timed quizzes, and manually unlock quiz attempts. As a moderator, you cannot remove student submissions. If you are creating Multiple Choice questions and quizzes, you may find the following CTSI tips sheets helpful: Multiple Choice Question and Quiz Tips and Multiple Choice Quercus Quiz Analysis Reports. Note about Quercus (Canvas) System Performance: For optimum course performance in the Quercus (Canvas) interface, quiz statistics will only generate for quizzes with 100 or fewer unique questions or 1,000 total attempts. For instance, a quiz with 200 questions will not generate quiz statistics. However, a quiz with 75 questions will generate quiz statistics until the quiz has reached 1000 attempts. Results greater than these maximum values can be viewed by downloading the Student Analysis report and viewing the CSV file.

Classic Quizzes vs. New Quizzes Feature Comparison Chart by Instructure, Canvas Community Peer Review and Assessment peerScholar The peerScholar peer assessment tool enables students to provide constructive feedback on each others' work and facilitates critical reflection on how they might improve their own work. peerScholar targets meta-cognitive thought processes, even in very large class contexts. peerScholar is an integrated tool/option in Quercus. It appears as an option when creating an Assignment. Peer Review Assignments Resolved: The issue regarding the Peer Review tool has been resolved. - Tuesday January 8, 2019 Please check the Quercus Quirks page for details and updates. How do I use peer review assignments in a course? How do I create a peer review assignment? How do I manually assign peer reviews for an assignment? How do I automatically assign peer reviews for an assignment? How do I view student peer review comments as an instructor? Rubrics Rubrics can be used for increasing grading efficiency, improving students’ understanding of expectations, and monitoring performance. Once you create a rubric, the rubric is saved in your course for future use. You can add the rubric to a graded Discussion, a Quiz, or an Assignment and use the rubric to grade submissions in SpeedGrader. Created rubrics can be managed in the Manage Rubrics page. Note: Be sure to review all Rubric Settings, including adding point values for rubric grading criteria, and consult with your Divisional support representative before grading student assignment submissions. Any changes to Rubric Settings that are made after grading has begun may not be accurately reflected in the assignment and may result is grade discrepancies. Non-Scoring Rubrics If you would like to create a rubric with grading criteria but with no point values attached, you can create a non-scoring rubric by checking the Remove points from rubric box when you add the rubric and select its settings. You can use non-scoring rubrics to assess student submissions in SpeedGrader. Return to Main Page Search the Quercus Support Resources"

Read more on the Quercus native discussion tool. Instructors should be aware that once a discussion board is enabled, they should carefully monitor the correspondence in the discussion to make sure students are using the tool effectively. Instructors who have not built this monitoring into their course's design may wish to avoid turning on discussion tools. For more about best teaching practices, please visit the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation's discussion board-related resources. Groups Organize students into groups in your course using Canvas Groups or UT Advanced Groups.

For instance, a quiz with 200 questions will not generate quiz statistics. However, a quiz with 75 questions will generate quiz statistics until the quiz has reached 1,000 attempts. Results greater than these maximum values can be viewed by downloading the Student Analysis report and viewing the CSV file.

For details, visit our New Gradebook Information page. Note about Quercus (Canvas) System Performance: The New Gradebook should render consistently in courses with a course weight of up to 80,000. A course weight is calculated as follows: (# of Students) X (# of Assignments). Grading Enter Grades For graded assignments, you can manually enter and edit grades directly in the selected cell. Click into a cell to highlight the cell with a crosshair. Enter a grade or edit an existing grade. You can also use SpeedGrader to view, comment, and grade student submissions directly within the browser. In the new Gradebook, SpeedGrader is accessible from the Grade Detail Tray. Note about Quercus (Canvas) System Performance: In large courses, SpeedGrader loading times are affected by a threshold of data points that can be loaded within a 60-second window. This threshold is based on a single submission per student. Multiple submissions by the same student increases the submission threshold. Assignments with more than 1,500 submissions may result in delayed SpeedGrader loading times, and assignments with more than 2,500 submissions may fail to load at all. Important Information about Letter Grades in Quercus A number of potential issues regarding the use of letter grades in Quercus have been identified. Please refer to the information in the link below if you are considering using letter grades in your Quercus Gradebook. Important information about letter grades in Quercus (October, 2018) Grade Detail Tray The Grade Detail Tray allows instructors to view and enter grades, submission status, and comments, both by individual assignment or student. Instructors can also access Speedgrader for an Assignment or view the individual Grades page for a student. To view the Grade Detail Tray, click on any cell in the Gradebook and click the Grade Detail Tray icon that appears. The Grade Detail Tray will open on the right side of the screen. Features The Grade Detail Tray offers the following features: Student Name: Select to view the individual student's Grade page Move Between Students: Click the arrows to advance to the next student’s details on the same assignment. Move Between Assignments: Click the arrows on either side of the Assignment Name to advance to the next assignment for the same student. SpeedGrader : Click on the link to go to the Speedgrader for the selected assignment. Grade Input Box: Use this box to enter, view, or change the student's grade for that submission. Status: Quercus automatically assigns a status based on the assignment due date and the student submission date. Use the Status box in the Grade Detail Tray to manually enter, view, or change student submission status. Available statuses include Late, Missing, Excused, or None. If you select the Late status you will also be able to specify the total number of days late. Note: You can customize the colours for all statuses except None by selecting Statuses in the View menu. Comments: Use this box to enter, view, edit, or delete comments for the submission. Click Submit to attach the comments to the submission. Note: Students will be able to view these comments only if the assignment grade is posted. If the assignment grade is hidden, they will not be able to see any instructor comments. Post or Hide Grades In the New Gradebook, the option to mute/unmute assignments has been updated with a Grade Posting Policy that allows instructors to define if grades are posted [1] automatically or [2] manually, at the course or assignment level: Automatically Post Grades: When this setting is selected for the course or an individual assignment, grades are visible to students as soon as they are entered. Manually Post Grades: When this setting is selected for the course or an individual assignment, grades are hidden from students until posted. NOTE: Automatically Post Grades is the default setting for every course in Quercus.

Search Students The default view of the Gradebook lists all active students in your course. You can use the Search field to search for an individual student by name, Student Number or UTORid. Late and Missing Submission Policies In the New Gradebook, the Settings menu (the gear icon) is where instructors can set grading rules for late and missing submissions. NOTE: Late Policies is the name of the tool in Quercus (Canvas) that instructors can use to calculate grades for late or missing submissions, as specified in the course syllabus. This tool is not associated with U of T Grading Policies. Please check with your department or division for Grading practices before implementing grade rules. 1. Access the Settings Menu To access the Settings menu, click the gear icon at the top right of the New Gradebook: Note: Features accessed via the gear icon in the current Gradebook have moved to other locations or have new icons in the New Gradebook. For additional information, please view the Functionality Comparison Current vs New Canvas Gradebook 2. Enable Late and Missing Submission Rules After clicking on the Settings menu icon, a Late Policies tab will appear: To enable a Missing Submission rule click the check box, and enter a percentage to be assigned when a submission is missing after the due date. For additional information, see: How do I apply a Missing Submission policy in the New Gradebook? To enable a Late Submission rule, click the check box , select a percentage to be deducted, and select for it to be deducted for each Day or Hour that it is late. You can also define a threshold percentage (Lowest possible grade percent) under which a student will not be scored, regardless of how late the submission is submitted. For additional information, see: How do I apply a Late Submission policy in the New Gradebook? Click Update to finalize the settings selected in [1] and/or [2]. 3. Important Considerations for Late and Missing Submission Rules If you choose to enable grading rules (called Policies in the New Gradebook) for Late and/or Missing submissions in your Quercus course, please be aware that these rules: Must be set up on a course-by-course basis. They do not apply at a global instructor level. Cannot be set for individual assignments. They will apply automatically to all online submission assignments, including quizzes and discussions. This includes assignments with due dates in the past. To exclude a specific assignment, submissions need to be manually changed to a status other than Late or Missing in the Grade Detail Tray. Do not apply to Paper Submission or No Submission assignments or assignments setup with external tools (including publisher integrations). Those assignment types can be manually designated as Missing or Late in the Grade Detail Tray. Their grades can also be calculated manually and adjusted accordingly. In addition, please consider the following best practices: Determine any rules you wish to apply to Late and/or Missing submissions and set them up in your Quercus course before creating assignments Include information about Late and/or Missing submissions in your course syllabus or outline. Consider linking to this information in every assignment description so that students are aware of any points that will be deducted for Late and/or Missing Submissions. For additional information on how Missing and Late policies work with online submission assignments, quizzes and discussions, please view the following documents from the Canvas Instructor Guides: How do I apply a Missing Submission policy in the New Gradebook?

There are two options to create student groups: Canvas Groups and UT Advanced Group tool. A Group Set houses the different Groups within a course for a given purpose, such as a collaborative project. Every Group has access to their own set of tools such as Discussions, Announcements, and Files. Each course can have multiple Group Sets.

When creating a Group Set, you could choose to automatically create groups within the Group Set and randomly assign students to groups, or create groups manually. Add Groups Manually After creating the Group Set, you can manually create groups under the Group Set. Click People on the course menu Click the Group Set tab Click on +Group button Name the group by typing in the Group Name If you want to limit groups to a specific size, enter the maximum number of group members in the Limit groups to field Click the Save button You can repeat these steps to create all the groups you need. Assign Students to Groups After creating the groups, you can randomly assign students to the groups, or choose to add students to the groups manually. Create Self Sign-up Groups Self sign-up groups are used to allow students to choose the group they want to be in as part of a Group Set. You can also limit the number of members who can sign up for each group. Students can join self sign-up groups through the People page. Group Assignments Once groups are created in your course, you can create group assignments to allow students to collaboratively work in teams. With group assignments, only one student in the group has to submit the assignment. Grade Group Assignments Online Submissions For online submitted files through Quercus, you can grade group assignments via SpeedGrader. When grading the assignment in SpeedGrader, it will show the Group names instead of the student names. Once you give the group a grade, everyone in that group will see the grade and the comments. Grades are typically assigned to the entire group, but you can choose to assign grades to students individually. Adjust Grade for Individual Group Members After assigning grades to the entire group, you can change the grade for individuals in the group by editing the assignment’s settings: click on the assignment Click the Edit button Check the box for Assign Grades to Each Student Individually Click Save Click on Grades on the course menu. Adjust the scores for individuals in the group Offline Submissions To grade No Submission or On Paper group assignments, click the Grades on the course menu and enter a score for one member in the group. It will be copied to the other group members. Group Discussions If you have a big class, it might be helpful to break your discussions into groups to have more intimate or group-specific discussions. To create a group discussion, you set up the discussion topic once, but it appears in multiple separate groups. Only the members of the group will see and respond to their group's post. UT Advanced Group Tool The UT Advanced Group Tool (UTAGT) allows course staff to perform a variety of advanced tasks such as create Groups using baseline rosters, create Sections from Groups, and batch enroll students into Groups. In This Section Access the Tool Create Baseline Group Sets Update Baseline Group Sets Remove All Group Members Clone Groups into Sections Update or Delete Sections Created From Groups Import Group Rosters Export Group Rosters Access the Tool The UT Advanced Group Tool is only accessible to users enrolled in a course as a Teacher, TA, Course Staff, Grader, Designer, or Librarian.

For example, course readings, library resources feed (example) or old course exams. Course Design Considerations □ Edit your Teacher Profile. Profiles allow instructors to update their name, preferred contact methods and share interesting facts about themselves using the biography feature. They can add specific links to course items or external pages (e.g., departmental webpage, your research webpage, link to a social media feed).□ Set your course homepage. As you design your course, think about the learning experience. What do you want students to see when they enter a course? How would you like to structure course content to support the learning and teaching experience?□ Organize your content. There are two options for organizing course content: Modules and Pages. As you design your course content, verify the due dates are correct. Organize course materials is a sequence in order for students to clearly follow along week by week during the course. Modules and Pages Watch the video Modules: Creation and Management Individual pages can be used to present content and information. Watch the video Pages: Creation and Management. □ Publish individual course items. Individual items added to a Module must be “published” in order for student to access/view the content. □ Download a class list or roster of students enrolled in course. Step-by-step instructions are available to download a copy of the class list using the Export feature in the Gradebook. □ Add columns to the Gradebook, assign weights, and enter grades. Grade columns are NOT created in the Gradebook directly. Columns are created when instructors create a graded assessment (assignments, graded quizzes, graded discussions) Watch the video Assignments Overview. See also the Canvas guide on the difference between a Canvas Assignment and a Canvas Activity. Watch the video on Assignment Creation. □ Set up your Gradebook Watch the video Gradebook Overview. Instructors can also create assignment categories (called “Assignment Groups”) Using the Assignment Groups feature allows instructors to organize course methods of assessment, and assign weights to each Assignment Group or category. □ Modify the Course Menu. The Course Navigation Menu provides access to course areas. Only the Home tool will be available to students in the course menu until the appropriate tools are made available by the instructor. Instructors can reorder and hide Course Navigation links in the course menu (Settings > Navigation) Note: Instructors cannot add new course menu items or edit the link titles in the menu list. □ Share the Student Quercus Guide. □ Publish your course. Course sites are created in an “unpublished” state. Instructors must manually make their course available to students by publishing the course.□ Create an Announcement. The Announcement tool is used to broadcast course information to everyone enrolled in the course.

Share OneDrive Files Modules Instructors can share OneDrive documents as an external tool in Modules. The embedded document can be viewed directly in the course. Rich Content Editor The Office 365 integration displays the OneDrive icon in the Rich Content Editor in Announcements, Assignments, Discussions, Pages, and Quizzes. The icon allows users to create a hyperlink to OneDrive files in the Rich Content Editor. Students can also view the icon anywhere they can access the Rich Content Editor, such as discussions and pages (as allowed). Create Office 365 Assignments Cloud Assignments Instructors can create Cloud Assignments through the Office 365 external tool which embeds a document directly from their Microsoft Office 365 (OneDrive) folder. This assignment type creates a view of the assignment file that acts as a template for individual student assignment submissions. Accepted assignment types are Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel. Students can open the document, make changes per the assignment instructions, and submit the edited template as their submission via the Quercus assignment page. Instructors can view each student's submission in SpeedGrader for grading. NOTE: Cloud assignments cannot be used for group assignments. File Upload Assignments Instructors can also continue to create regular file upload assignments. When an instructor allows file uploads, students can view the Office 365 tab and upload files directly from their OneDrive. The accepted file types are Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint, Microsoft Excel, and PDF. NOTE: Students can only submit one Office 365 file for their submission. NOTE: When Office 365 files are uploaded as a submission, later changes made to the file in student's OneDrive will not be updated in the submission. Create Collaborations Quercus Collaborations allows multiple users to work together on a single Office 365 (Word, Excel, or PowerPoint) document at the same time. Collaborative documents are saved in real-time, meaning a change made by any of collaborators will be immediately visible to other collaborators. Collaborations can be created at the course level or the group level. Course-Level Collaborations Instructors can create course-level collaborations by clicking Collaborations on the course navigation menu. Students can also create and view collaborative documents via Collaborations menu item. Individual users or groups from the course can be added to participate in the collaboration. Once a user is invited to a collaboration, the collaboration file is available to the user in the user's Microsoft OneDrive. Uninviting the user or deleting the collaboration does not remove access to the collaboration once a user has been added. In order to restrict access to the Office 365 item for an uninvited user, or deleted collaboration, the creator must manually modify the sharing settings on OneDrive. Once a term ends or a course is concluded, the collaboration document will still be available from Quercus and Office 365 OneDrive. if the document settings remain unchanged, users can still access the collaboration file, but any updates are not reflected in course notifications. If you want to retain the collaboration document as part of the course or for your records, you may consider changing the sharing settings so the document is no longer available to any users, or it is only available for viewing. Group-Level Collaborations For group-specific collaborations, instructors can consider creating a new collaboration for each group or creating a group collaboration from within the group. Students can also create collaborations from within their own groups to collaborate on an office 365 document. NOTE: If a collaboration is created from within the group, all group members would be able to edit or delete the collaboration. NOTE: For Collaborations created from within the group homepage, collaborators must be added individually via the People tab.

Troubleshooting & FAQ Overview: Team Up! is a web-based group assessment tool designed to encourage group/team work, peer teaching, engagement with course materials, and active learning. In addition, the assessment tool is designed to provide immediate feedback and helps students work together to reach a consensus before choosing their answer.

Points (in the form of diamonds) are awarded based on how many attempts are required to obtain the correct answer; typically 5 points are awarded if a group is correct on the first try, 3 points if two tries are required, etc. Your instructor may use a different point scoring system. How to Access a Team Up! Session on Quercus: In Team Up!, students can create and join groups to work on quiz questions as a team. Your instructor may have also pre-assigned you to Team Up! groups. The instructions below provide a general outline, but your instructor for your course may have more specific instructions. Decide which student in your group will be the Leader (Driver) for the session. Log-in to Quercus from your device (phone, tablet, computer). Click on the Team Up! Quiz you have been assigned (usually found in the Assignments, Quizzes or Modules tab of your course). Click Go to Tool to access Team Up!. If your instructor has pre-assigned groups, all you need to do is vote for the Leader (Driver) by clicking on that person’s name at the top of your team’s Team Up! Session. You can now skip down to the How to Participate in Team Up! below. If your instructor has asked you to form groups spontaneously (i.e. you are not in a pre-assigned group), your team’s Leader (Driver) must create a group and obtain your team’s unique Group ID for this session. The Leader then tells the remaining team members what the unique Group ID is so that they can join the existing group. The unique Group ID is found at the top of the Team Up! Session created. The person who created the Group is automatically the Leader or Driver. How to Participate in Team Up!: Your Role as the Driver: The Driver acts as team leader, responsible for navigating the quiz as well as submitting the team’s final agreed upon answer to a question. The driver can also enter feedback if requested by the instructor. Drivers are also responsible for submitting the final quiz score to Quercus. The Driver has a steering wheel next to their ID and is differently coloured than other Team Members. Your Role as a Team Member: Team Members participate and choose their answers, so all team mates can see what they have chosen, but they cannot submit their choices to Team Up!. The Driver chooses a question, and the team can participate by choosing their own answers and discussing their choices with each other. Once the team decides on a final answer, the driver chooses it and clicks the Check Answer button. Note: The Driver can check an answer despite what the team members choose, so be careful that you have consensus before clicking the Check Answer button. You cannot undo. If the answer is correct, you will be awarded the full score or “diamonds” for that question. You will be able to proceed onwards by clicking the Next button that will appear under the Check Answer button or by clicking on the question in the menu on the left. If your team’s answer is not correct, discuss the question and choose again. Repeat until you get the correct answer. All team mates can see whether responses are correct/incorrect as well as their team’s overall score as they progress through the Team Up! session. After completing the quiz, click the Review & Submit tab. The Driver MUST click Submit to Quercus to send your group’s Team Up! quiz scores to Quercus for grading. If the Driver forgets, no one on the team will see a grade in the Grades section of your Quercus course. Once the score has been submitted by the Driver, you can exit the Team Up! Session by closing your browser tab. It’s a good idea to check that your score shows in the Grades section of your course. If not, please remind your Driver to Submit to Quercus. Troubleshooting & FAQ: My screen seems to be lagging compared to those of my group members (eg. I’m not on the same question as the driver/members, the answer I chose does not appear on my group members’ screens, etc.) As long as you are logged in, you will receive your grade, so just continue to participate by communicating with your team. Almost always, your device will re-sync with the rest of your team’s devices within a minute or two. If not, refresh your screen once. Repeatedly refreshing is not usually helpful! I’ve been disconnected. Will my quiz progress be saved? Can I re-join my group? Enter the TeamUp! session again and you will automatically be put back into your group. Your progress will be saved, and you will return to the question you or your group was working on. This is true for the Driver as well as any team member. The Driver of my group has to leave unexpectedly or their device has stopped functioning. How do we proceed with the quiz? Request for a Driver Change using the red button at the top right of your TeamUp! Session. This button only provides help for Driver Changes. You may also need to speak with your instructor or TA.

Instructors must include the Conditions of Use statement in their course syllabus. Turnitin use at the University is based entirely on the Conditions of Use and for course work only. On This Page Overview U of T Conditions of Use Statement Set Up a Turnitin Assignment Create Assignment Customize Turnitin Settings Availability and Due Dates File Types and Sizes Guidelines Similarity Reports View the Similarity Report Exclude Sources from the Report View and Restore Sources Resources and Support Academic Integrity Support Contacts System Status Student Documentation Troubleshooting Issues Overview Turnitin is a tool that assists with detecting textual similarities between compared works. Instructors must exercise their independent professional judgment in looking at the Similarity Report and determining whether a text has been plagiarized. Note: Turnitin is an integrated tool in Quercus. It appears as an option when creating an Assignment. With the Turnitin integration in Quercus courses, class and assignment setup using the Turnitin.com website is not supported at U of T. Turnitin is not supported for use with Canvas mobile apps. Conditions of Use at the University of Toronto The Turnitin Conditions of Use statement is available in Quercus courses for instructors to copy and paste in the course syllabus. On the Quercus course home page, navigate to the right-hand sidebar menu (under Course Status) and click on the Turnitin Conditions button: The Conditions of Use are also listed below: Before setting up a Turnitin Assignment item instructors should be aware of the following: 1. instructors must copy the text below (in its entirety) and paste it in their course outline or syllabus at the start of the course. This statement was prepared by the University lawyers and cannot be altered in any way. “Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to Turnitin.com for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of the Turnitin.com service are described on the Turnitin.com web site.” 2. Students are permitted, under our conditions of use, to opt-out of using Turnitin. Students should inform instructors at the start of the course if they choose to opt out of Turnitin. If a student chooses not to submit their assignment through Turnitin, instructors will need to find alternative arrangements to check their work as rigorously. (Note that over the years, very few students have opted out.) Students cannot be penalized for choosing to opt out. For any student who does not submit to Turnitin, instructors can manually enter their grade in the same Gradebook column that includes the assignments that were submitted through the Turnitin assignment in their Quercus course. For information on alternative methods to submitting to Turnitin see this page from the Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation (CTSI). Set Up a Turnitin Assignment Turnitin assignments are an option when you create an assignment in your Quercus course.

Text Entry may be used for short assignment submissions that are 500 words or less. File Upload is recommended for assignment submissions. Select Restrict Upload File Types to restrict submissions to specific file types. Enter a list of accepted extensions, separated by commas (see Turnitin File Types and Sizes) From the Plagiarism Review drop-down menu, Select Turnitin Customize Turnitin Settings Select Turnitin settings to suit your assignment. For best results, use the following settings: Store submissions in: Select Institution paper repository from the drop-down menu. This option ensures that the student submissions for your assignment are stored in U of T's paper repository for comparison with future student papers. Do not store the submitted papers means that after the similarity check has been performed on the submission, the file will not be stored in U of T's paper repository. The Standard paper repository is not available at U of T. Compare submissions against: Ensure all four options have been checked. Similarity Report: Leave all options unchecked. Note: It is not recommended to Exclude Sources when creating an assignment. If necessary, these sources can be excluded from within the Similarity Report itself. Save Turnitin settings: Select Save as default settings to make these selections the default settings for future Turnitin assignments in the course. Show report to students: Choose whether students can view their Similarity Report by selecting one of four options: Immediately: Students can view the report on submission (as soon as it is generated by Turnitin) After the assignment is graded: Students can view the report as soon as it has been graded in Quercus. After the due date: Students can view the report as soon as the assignment due date passes. Never: Students cannot view the report at any time. Instructors will be able to see the report after students submit the assignment.

Assignment Availability and Due Dates For each paper submitted, Turnitin generates a Similarity Report. The dates you set in Quercus affect when assignments are submitted to Turnitin and when Similarity Reports are generated. Navigate to the Assign to menu at the bottom of the Assignment Details page to set: Due : date and time the assignment is due Available from: date and time the assignment will become available Available to: date and time the assignment will no longer be available Common Scenarios with Due and Available to dates Scenario Due Date Available to Date Description Open Assignments NO NO Students can submit/resubmit assignment at any time, until course end date.

Student access to Similarity Report will be affected if the option to Show Report to Students Once Due date has Passed is selected. For additional information about working with assignment dates in Turnitin, see Handling Dates Turnitin File Types and Size Guidelines Turnitin will accept most file types that are less than 40mb; that have a minimum of 20 words; and that are less than 400 pages. For more details about the types of files that will generate a Similarity Report, see Turnitin File Types and Size Guidelines Similarity Reports For each paper submitted, a Similarity Report (formerly called \"Originality Report\") is generated by Turnitin. For the first submission, the report is normally generated within 5-10 minutes of submission. Similarity Reports for the second or subsequent submissions will take up to 24 hours to generate. The Similarity Report highlights any passages that match other materials in the Turnitin database or on the web. Turnitin automatically excludes papers submitted to the same assignment in the same class by the same student. Students will only see their most recent submission but instructors can access each submissions in the SpeedGrader. Similarity Reports do not indicate whether a student has plagiarized. They help to identify sources that contain textual similarities in submitted papers. Instructors must use their own judgment to determine if plagiarism has occurred. View the Similarity Report You can access the Similarity Report from SpeedGrader. To view the Similarity Report for an assignment submission: Navigate to SpeedGrader from Assignments or the Gradebook to view student submissions To see the Similarity Report, click on the Similarity Score icon (colored square containing a percentage) on the right side of the SpeedGrader interface. A new tab will open and take you to the Turnitin Feedback Studio where you can view the Similarity Report. For more information on Similarity Reports, see: Turnitin's page on Interpreting Similarity Reports Understanding Turnitin and the Similarity Report (PDF) from U of T's Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation. Excluding Sources from the Similarity Report Applying filtering options to an individual Similarity Report allows you to exclude sources that you do not want the submission to match against. In certain cases, this may provide a clearer similarity index (percentage). It is possible to exclude up to 1000 sources from a single report. It is not recommended to Exclude Sources when creating an assignment. Note: Excluding sources from a Similarity Report will recalculate the Similarity Index without taking into account the removed source. Any changes in in the similarity score will be saved inside the Turnitin Similarity Report but will not be reflected in the Similarity Score Icon in the SpeedGrader. Exclude Full Sources This option can be used when a paper has been submitted twice or more to Turnitin (e.g. with a Draft Assignment) and the Similarity Report is reporting a high match (e.g. 100%) to a previous submission: Select the All Sources icon (graph) in the red similarity toolbar. Click the Exclude Sources button at the bottom. Click on the check-boxes next to the sources you want to exclude. Click the red Exclude button at the bottom of the page. Exclude Small Sources This option can be used to exclude sources that are less than a certain number of words or a certain percentage of words (e.g. to exclude commonly used phrases in a specific discipline). Select the Filters and Settings icon (funnel) in the red similarity toolbar. From the Filters and Settings side panel, use the radio and text boxes to exclude sources that are less than a certain number of words or sources that are less than certain percentage match. For example, filtering by 3 words will exclude all sources with a cumulative match word count that is less than 3 words. Filtering by 10% will exclude all sources that have a match of less than 10%. Select Apply Changes to confirm. Exclude Quotes and Bibliographies This option can be used to exclude quoted materials and bibliographies from the Similarity Report, especially where students in the same class are working on the same topic and may use similar reference lists and quotes in their submissions. Select the Filters and Settings icon in the red similarity toolbar. From the Filters and Settings side panel, use the check boxes to exclude quoted and/or bibliographic material. Select Apply Changes to confirm. Viewing and Restoring Excluded Sources Excluded sources can be viewed and restored if needed. The restored sources will automatically update the Similarity Report and will be reflected in the similarity score (percentage). These changes will not be reflected in the Similarity Score Icon in the SpeedGrader. To view excluded sources, click on the red Excluded Sources icon (a circle with a line through it) in the red icon group . To restore individual excluded sources click on the check-box next to the source you'd like to restore, and click the Restore button To restore all excluded sources click the Restore All Resources and Support Academic Integrity Support Contacts Instructors who have questions about the process for the handling of suspected academic offences should contact their department/division (in many cases this would be the undergraduate chair or associate chair/dean).

Instructors use the software to pose multiple-choice questions to students during class. Students respond to the questions using iClicker hand-held remote control devices, which transmit individual responses to the instructor's computer to record and share results with the class. iClickers are a great way to increase student engagement, especially in large classes, and provide immediate feedback on student understanding of the course material. iClicker is an optional integration in Quercus. The integration allows for data to be transferred between iClicker Gradebook and the Gradebook in Quercus courses. This enables students to register their iClicker remotes directly within their Quercus course. It allows instructors to easily download the class list and student registrations from Quercus. Instructors can also upload iClicker session data to the course Gradebook in Quercus . Student Engagement Not Formal Assessment Please note that iClicker is supported for in-class audience response only. Instructors who wish to use this technology for formal assessment purposes should note that limitations with the technology, including WiFi and cellular connectivity, might limit the feasibility of using it for assessment. Please contact the U of T Bookstore for additional support in making adoption decisions. Used Remotes As of December 31, 2014, students who have purchased a used remote and register their used remote online with iclicker.com will be charged a one-time fee of $6.99. Instructors are encouraged to enable the iClicker integration tool in Quercus courses. This will allow students who purchase used iClicker remotes to register their remotes in their Quercus course without paying a $6.99 used remote registration fee.

Overview The peerScholar peer assessment tool enables students to provide constructive feedback on each others' work and facilitates critical reflection on how they might improve their own work. peerScholar targets meta-cognitive thought processes, even in very large class contexts. Developed by Professor Steve Joordens and Dwayne Pare at the University of Toronto Scarborough, the tool is designed to allow students to think critically and creatively, to be analytic, and to communicate their thoughts clearly through peer assessment. peerScholar is available for use in Quercus courses. Important note about grading and peerScholar:At U of T, Instructors or TAs, rather than students, must provide the final grades on peerScholar assignments. These final grades may be informed by peer feedback and must be interpreted by an expert grader in combination with other pedagogical factors that are relevant (e.g., the quality of peer comments, etc). This approach allows the evidence-based pedagogical benefits of peer-assessment to be harnessed in a way that is consistent with current institutional labour practices. Step-by-Step Instructions peerScholar assignments are created by selecting the option for peerScholar when you create an assignment in your Quercus course. 1. Select Assignments from the left side menu and the \"+ Assignment\" button at top right OR if creating this from within a module, select the the \"+\" button (and select Assignment> [New Assignment]) 2.

MasteryPaths allows instructors to customize or differentiate learning based on student performance. Instructors identify different activities for each learning path to help students in that path to achieve mastery. Source and Conditional Release Items In MasteryPaths, students complete a graded Source item - a quiz, assignment, or discussion. After the Source item has been graded (either manually or automatically), the student’s score designates which Conditional Release item(s) they are assigned as a learning path. Note: If you are interested in using MasteryPaths, we suggest that you first consult with your Divisional support representative or contact q.help@utoronto.ca. Enabling MasteryPaths To enable MasteryPaths in your Quercus course: 1. Click on Settings in the Course Navigation menu 2. On the Feature Options tab, click the MasteryPaths slider to ON. The slider will be green when activated. Setting Up a MasteryPath A MasteryPath originates from the course modules page. Before designating Source and Conditional Release items, all assignments and pages should be finalized and added to the module as module items before the MasteryPath is published. 1. Create the Source Item In a Module, create the Source item. The Source MUST be a graded: assignment, discussion, or quiz (A graded quiz that with multiple attempts available can serve as a Source item. This allows students to take progressively more challenging paths as their score improves). Before students can access the Conditional Release items in their learning path, grades for the Source item must be posted. If the Source item requires manual grading (i.e. contains text-based responses), you will need to do both of the following: input the assignment grades in the Gradebook, and post the assignment grades. 2. Create the Conditional Release Items In the same Module, create the Conditional Release items. These items form the content of each learning path. Any course item except practice quizzes and ungraded surveys may be designated as Conditional Release items. 3. Allow Conditional Release Items for the MasteryPath Pages If you want to add a page as a Conditional Release item, you must first allow the page in MasteryPaths. In the module, open the page by clicking on the name of the page. Click the Edit button. At the bottom of the page, click the Allow in Mastery paths checkbox. Click the Save button. Assignments, Quizzes and Discussions By default, assignments, quizzes and discussions are assigned to Everyone. This means all students are able to view them. To use these items as Conditional Release items in a MasteryPath, they must be Assigned to MasteryPaths, rather than to Everyone. Click on the assignment, quiz, or discussion and click the Edit button. Scroll to the Assign to box, delete Everyone and select MasteryPaths instead. Click Save. 4. Configure the MasteryPath Configuring the MasteryPath involves designating the Source item and all your Conditional Release items for each path. Click on the name of the Source item. Click the Edit button and select the Mastery Paths tab. There are a maximum of three paths that can be created. Review the performance ranges for each path and adjust if needed by selecting the points boxes and typing in your preferred range. The example below shows the possible point ranges or paths for a Quiz with a total of 20 points. For each path, click ' + ' to select Conditional Release from the list of items that you have already added to the module. These items are assigned to specific students through conditional rules in the three scoring ranges. Search for the conditional content [1] or use the drop-down menu [2] to select the type of conditional content you want to add. Check the box next to the item(s) you want to add [3] and click the Add Items button [4]. If you do not want to assign any content to the students in a particular range, you may leave that path blank. When more than one item is added to a range, by default students will be required to complete all of the items (as noted by the & button). If you want to give students a choice between items in a path, click the & button. The items will separate and the & will change to an Or button. This allows students to select which item(s) to complete as part of the path. . Note: Each of the options must be distinct at the path level. It is not possible to have a hierarchy within a path or to nest the & or Or options. Important Considerations 1. Source Item The Source item that launches the paths must be a GRADED item and will therefore impact students' course grade. If you do not want performance in the Source item to impact course grades, you may need to adjust scores manually before final grades are calculated. You will also need to communicate this clearly to students because they will see that they have scored a certain number of points associated with this assessment. 2. Conditional Release Items If there are graded conditional items within the paths, ensure that the total number of points available is the same for each path. Due dates for Conditional Release items are not applied when the item is released to students. To add due dates for conditional items, wait until all students have completed the initial assignment and then add due dates to the conditional items. 3. Testing the MasteryPath Always test your MasteryPath before making it available to students. It is much easier to make adjustments to the MasteryPath before any of your students have started working on the Source item. You can use Student View to check the students' Modules page and confirm that all Conditional Release items have been assigned to MasteryPaths correctly. The only course items that should be visible to the Test Student are items assigned to Everyone. If the Test Student can view a Conditional Release item without having completed any coursework, the assignment may not have assigned to MasteryPaths. Pedagogical Uses MasteryPaths is intended to help differentiate learning experiences for students, while maintaining course outcomes and standards. Within the University of Toronto context, MasteryPaths may be helpful in achieving the following pedagogical goals: Providing students with enrichment and/or review opportunities, Providing students with choice of assignment topics or types of assignment submissions, or Providing students with choice of learning materials according to their learning preferences (view a video or read an article, for example).

Introduction: Two Methods of Presenting Course Content Course content can be presented in two ways: Modules and Pages. Modules are a way to organize course content. Pages give flexibility on how to display course content. Modules can link to Pages, and Pages can link to Modules. Additional Resource: Video giving an overview of the modules and pages approach in Canvas. 2. Organizing your Course into Modules Modules allow instructors to determine the order and structure (eg. by week, unit, or topic) in which the content will be released to the end-user to provide a guided learning experience. Why use modules? Organization. Allows the students to move through the course in a predetermined order set by the instructor. Prerequisites. Help students avoid missing course content or assignments by setting completion prerequisites. Monitor Progress. Help both the instructor and students monitor their progression through course content. Open Modules: In Course Navigation, select the Modules link. Add a new Module: Select the + Module button. Add Module name: Type a name in the Module Name field. Lock Module date: If you want to restrict the module until a specific date, you can lock the module. Add Module prerequisites: If you have added at least one module to your course, you can require a prerequisite module. A prerequisite module means students must complete the previous modules before they can view the new module. Add Module: Select the Add Module button. 3. Adding Items to your Module and Publishing Modules You can add new or existing content items in Quercus to a module. You can also add an item to multiple modules, or multiple iterations of an item to one module Open Modules: In Course Navigation, select the Modules link. Add Module item: Click the Add Item (+) button. Add new item: From the Add drop-down menu and select one of the following item types: • Assignment• Quiz• File (document and media file types)• Content Page• Discussion• External URL• External Tool (Note: Instructors can share OneDrive documents as an external tool in Modules. The embedded document can be viewed directly in the course.) Add existing item: If you have already created the item you want to add, click the name of the item. You can select more than one item to add. Add new item: If you want to add a new item, click the New link and type a name in the name field. Depending on the item type, when adding new content you may be asked to complete additional fields. Indent item: Choose the Indentation drop-down menu to indent the item inside of the module. Add item: Click on the Add Item button. View Module item: From the side menu click on Modules. Publish Module item: Click on Publish button to make it visible to students. Publish Module: To publish a module, click the module’s unpublished icon To unpublish a module, hover over the published icon and click the icon to confirm. When you publish a module, all of the items in that module also become published. This is seen only after refreshing the webpage. If you would like to publish a module BUT there are certain module items that you do not want published: 1) publish the module, 2) refresh the webpage, and 3) unpublish any module items that you do not want to be available to students. . 4. Building and Publishing Pages in Your Course Pages allow instructors to display a smaller amount of information, for example, a specific topic. Having a similar feel to a webpage, Pages are multimodal and can display text, embedded videos, images and files, all in one scrollable area. Why use pages?Context. Help students understand what they should focus on and what they should be learning. Multimodal. Readings, links, images, videos and more, can be placed in one area for a complete lesson. Open Pages: In Course Navigation, select the Pages link. View Pages: Pages is designed to open to the front page for the course, if there is a front page selected. To select a page from the Pages Index, select the View All Pages button. Add Page: Select the Add Page button. Add content: i. Type a name for your page. ii. Use the Rich Content Editor to create content for your page. The Office 365 integration displays the OneDrive icon in the Rich Content Editor in Pages and allows users to create a hyperlink to OneDrive files directly in the Rich Content Editor.iii. You can also add links, files, and images to the Page using the content selector. Edit page settings: You can decide who can edit the page by selecting the who can edit this page drop down menu. Options include only teachers, teachers and students, or anyone. You can also notify users that content has changed by selecting the Notify users that this content has changed checkbox. Save and Publish: If you are ready to publish your page, click the Save & Publish button. If you want to create a draft of your page, click the Save button.

Select Time adjustments menu (e.g. to add additional time or remove time limits) View the adjustments in the Moderate panel: Attempts adjustments appear in the Attempts column Timer adjustments appear in the Accommodations column Accommodations The accommodations column in the Moderate panel allow instructors to apply course-level accommodations for students. To add course-level accommodations for a student: On the Moderation page, navigate to the Accommodations column, find the student you want to apply the accommodation for and click the Edit icon. Select an option from the Time adjustments menu: adding time, removing time limits, or multiplying time limits by a set multiplier. Save your accommodations. View the accommodations in the Accommodations column of the Moderate panel NOTES: Accommodations apply to all assessments in a course for a student. Only one accommodation can be set per student. The Accommodations column in the Moderate panel displays the cumulative effect of accommodations (course-level) and moderation (assessment-level) timer settings. Manually Submit Student Quiz Attempts Instructors can submit outstanding quiz submissions on behalf of their students. This feature can be used when a student cannot or forgets to submit a quiz after starting the quiz, and the quiz needs to be graded, specifically for situations where the quiz will not auto-submit. A quiz will automatically be submitted if: The quiz has a Time Limit: quiz is auto-submitted if time expires when the student is taking the quiz The quiz has an Available Until date: quiz is auto-submitted at Until date The quiz has both Time Limit and Available Until date: quiz is auto-submitted when the time expires unless the Until date expires first In order to manually submit student quiz attempts: On the Moderate page, click the number of attempts in progress. By default, all student names are selected. Deselect attempts that should not be submitted. Click Submit Manually. Assessment Grading You can grade New Quizzes assessments in the SpeedGrader. The example below shows the SpeedGrader display for a multiple-choice question. If your assessment includes questions that require manual grading (i.e. essay and file upload questions), a warning message will also display to show the questions that need to be reviewed manually. In SpeedGrader, you can: View assessment Results, including the percentage score, point score, and time to complete attempt. Use the Arrow buttons to increase or decrease the score for a question (Note: Refresh the page or click Submit in the right-hand panel of the SpeedGrader for the change to apply) Add a Comment for the question Regrade the question for the entire assessment to change the correct answer or the point value of the question. NOTES: Regrading only applies to completed submissions. If all students will be affected by the regrade, please wait for all students to submit before regrading. Regrading is not available for Essay or File Upload questions. For the Categorization question type, only point values can be changed (correct answers cannot be changed) For additional information on regrading a New Quizzes assessment, refer to How do I regrade an assessment question in New Quizzes?

This includes the option to have Quercus send course communications directly to their University email account inbox. Notifications can be enabled for many activities including new student submissions, assignment grades available, or new Inbox conversation messages. Email notifications are generated from the address notifications@instructure.com. Please note that your notification preferences only apply to your profile. Customizing Notifications Instructions on how to adjust notification preferences are the same for students, instructors, and course staff. For a more in-depth understanding of notifications and their triggers, please refer to the Canvas Notifications PDF. Student Responsibility and Course Communications Students should login to Quercus (https://q.utoronto.ca) and reply to course messages using the communication tools in Quercus. As part of university policy, students are required to ensure that all Quercus communications are sent to their official university-issued email address. Students should reply to course messages and Quercus notifications using the Inbox tool. All of Quercus' correspondence is sent to a university-issued e-mail address; this is university policy. Due to this policy, in order to receive email from Quercus, students must update ACORN, U of T's student information service, with their official university-issued e-mail address. While the policy does not preclude forwarding University e-mails to an external provider such as Gmail, Hotmail etc., this is not recommended. Forwarding is appreciably less reliable than direct delivery, and special attention should be paid to the section of the policy that states: \"Students have the right to forward their University issued electronic mail account to another electronic mail service provider address but remain responsible for ensuring that all University electronic message communication sent to the official University-issued account is received and read.\" All communication via Quercus is sent to an university-issued email address by default, as defined in ACORN, U of T's student information service. Users have the ability to customize their notification preferences and contact methods, however it is university policy that students are responsible for receiving and reading messages in their institutional email account. From the policy: \"Students have the right to forward their University issued electronic mail account to another electronic mail service provider address but remain responsible for ensuring that all University electronic message communication sent to the official University-issued account is received and read.\" Additional Contact Methods It is always recommended to set the institutional University of Toronto email address as the main, default address. However, users have the option of adding additional email address or install the Canvas Student Mobile App. These instructions are the same for students, instructors, and course staff.

On This Page Course Level Reports Course Statistics Course Analytics New Analytics Student Interactions Report Individual Level Reports Student Analytics Access Report Interactions Report Quercus Tools Grades Gradebook Data Quizzes Moderate Quiz Quiz Logs Quiz Statistics Quiz Analysis Reports Modules Progression through Modules Integrated Tools TurnitIn Similarity Reports Course Level Reports Course Statistics Course Statistics provide macro-level course information including course totals, assignments, students, and file storage: Totals provides running totals of the various course items including Discussions, Assignments, Quizzes and active students. Assignments allows you to view the different assessment types, the number of assignments and number of submissions received. Students shows you which students have recently logged on to Quercus. From this tab you can also access a User Details page where you can see Student Grades, the Interactions Report, the Access Report, the Outcomes Report, and Analytics. File Storage presents the Alloted Storage for your course, the number of uploaded files, and media files. Any files from a previous course import or course copy are not included in the storage quota or files count. It is good to check to see where you are relative to the allotted storage particularly if you have a media rich course. Course Analytics Course Analytics works in conjunction with Course Statistics and provides macro-level information about your course. Data can be displayed as graphs or tables. There are four sections in Course Analytics: Activity by Date reveals when students viewed a page or participated in the course. Submissions allow you to see the percentage of students who have submitted each assignment in your course On Time, Late or not at all (Missing). Grades provides a box and whisker plot of the distribution of students grades in the course (median, high and low scores, and performance from the 25th-75th percentile). Students displays as a table showing Students, Page Views, Participations, Submissions (On Time, Late and Missing) and Current Score in the course. Clicking on an individual student name opens Student Analytics. New Analytics View average course grade analytics as an interactive chart graph Compare the course average with an individual assignment, course section, or student filter using the chart graph comparison View average weekly online participation analytics as an interactive chart graph Compare the course average weekly online participation analytics with an individual student or section using the chart graph comparison Send a message to all students based on specific course grade Send a message to an individual student based on specific course grade View course grade and participation analytics for an individual student Student Interactions Report The Student Interactions Report allows you to see and evaluate the interactions between you and your students at a course level. Interactions include contact with the student via Conversations and when you leave a comment on an assignment. The Student Interactions Report presents: Student shows the name of each student enrolled. Last Student Interaction reveals when you last interacted with the student. Current Score reflects the score for all graded activities. It does not include any assignment or quiz that has not yet been submitted or graded. Final Score is calculated based on all graded activities in the course, whether or not it has been given an actual grade. Ungraded Assignments shows a list of ungraded assignments and when they were submitted. Message allows you to message individual students. Individual Level Reports Student Analytics Use Student Analytics to see how well an individual student is performing in the course. This information can be displayed as graphs or tables and includes Activity by Date, Communication, Submissions, and Grades. Student Analytics are accessed by clicking on the name of an individual student in the Students portion of Course Analytics. Activity by Date shows all Page Views and Participations of the student in the course. Communication illustrates all interactions between the student and instructor(s) by date. Notifications and Announcements are not included in communication analytics. Submissions displays each assignment by due date and whether it was submitted On Time, Late or not at all (Missing) as well as the student’s score. Grades shows how the student scored on each assignment relative to their peers. Scores are presented as Good Score, Fair Score and Poor Score. Access Report The Access Report complements the Total Activity column in the People section. It provides detailed information about individual participation in the course. The Access Report reveals: Content is a list of content items in the course the user has viewed. Times Viewed reflects the number of times the student has viewed the content. Times Participated presents the number of times a user has participated in a discussion or submitted an assignment, where applicable. Last Viewed is the time the user last viewed the content. Interactions Report The Interactions Report summarizes individual student – instructor interactions and complements the Student Interactions Report. Interactions include contact with the student via Conversations and when you leave a comment on an assignment. The Interactions Report presents: Student is the name the student. Last Student Interaction reveals when you last interacted with the student. Current Score reflects the score for all graded activities. It does not include any assignment or quiz that has not yet been submitted or graded. Final Score is calculated based on all graded activities in the course, whether or not it has been given an actual grade. Ungraded Assignments shows a list of ungraded assignments and when they were submitted. Message allows you to message the individual student. Quercus Tools Grades Gradebook Data The Gradebook helps you to view and enter student grades. Only graded items appear in the Gradebook. Ungraded assignments are not displayed. While the default Gradebook view presents all active students in a course, an Individual View is also available. Individual assignment columns in the Gradebook can be sorted by: assignment grade, or assignment status. Gradebook columns can be arranged by: assignment name, due date, points, or module. You can also manually arrange columns or increase and decrease the width of any column. Assignments in the Gradebook can also be filtered by: assignment group, sections, and modules. Assignment Details is not currently available in the New Gradebook. Until the feature is made available, you may do the following: to view assignment high score and low score, sort assignment column by Grade use SpeedGrader, centre of the menu bar, to view total number of submissions (1) and assignment average score (2) Gradebook History is a log of Gradebook changes. It includes: the date of the change, student whose grade was changed, grader who changed the grade, assignment where the grade was changed, grade before the change was made (if applicable), grade after the change was made, and the current grade. A Notes column is available in the Gradebook to store notes about student details or individual assignment submissions. The Notes column is not visible to students. By clicking on a student’s name, you can view a Student Context Card that displays: the student’s section, last log in, grade, analytics, number of missing or late assignments, number of graded items, and activity compared to others in the course. To ensure that student records are complete and secure, you may wish to Export Grades as a CSV file and download it to your computer each time a set of marks for a test or assignment is entered and at the end of the course. If you prefer to grade outside of Quercus, you can also use CSV file to Import changes to upload changes to the Gradebook. Please see Important Information about Letter Grades in Quercus. Quizzes Moderate Quiz Once the quiz is published, the Moderate Quiz page allows you to view: Student is the student's name. Attempt is the number of times the student has already attempted to take the quiz. Time shows you how long it took the student to complete the quiz. Attempts Left is the number of attempts remaining, if any. Score is the student's grade on the quiz. If multiple attempts are permitted, the score is the most recent attempt. The Moderate Quiz page can also be used to give students extra attempts or time on quizzes. Quiz Logs Quiz Logs allow you investigate problems that a student may have in a quiz and see the status of student quizzes. The Action Log provides a timestamp for when a student: Starts the quiz (date and time); Attempts the quiz an additional time (when multiple attempts are available); Views a question; Answers a question; Stops viewing the quiz (being inactive, navigating to another course page, or going to another browser tab or window for more than 15 seconds), and; Resumes the quiz. Quiz Statistics Quiz Statistics are available for published quizzes with at least one submission. Quiz statistics will only generate for quizzes with 100 or fewer questions or 1000 total attempts. When quizzes exceed this number of questions or total attempts, results can be viewed by downloading the Student Analysis report. Quiz Statistics include a Quiz Summary and Question Breakdown. Quiz Summary shows statistics for all students including: average score, high score, low score, standard deviation and average time of quiz completion. The Question Breakdown section presents statistics for each quiz question depending on the question type. Set Answer Choice (i.e. multiple choice) questions display: The number of attempts, percentage of students who answered correctly, number and percentage of students who selected each answer in the set; The names of students who selected a particular answer can be seen by clicking on the number of respondents for that answer; and True/ False and Multiple Choice also include an item discrimination index that shows how well the question discriminates between students who do well on the quiz and student who do not. No Set Answer Choice (i.e Fill-in-the-Blank) questions display: The number and percentage of students who selected the correct answer as well as entries other than the correct answer. Manually Graded Questions (i.e. essay, file upload) display: The number and percentage of respondents in three ranges: top 27%, middle 46%, and bottom 27%; and The submissions not yet graded. Quiz Analysis Reports Two Quiz Analysis Reports are available. The Student Analysis Report is a comma separated values (CSV) file that can be downloaded for the quiz that provides the following information for each student: name, id, section, date submitted, number of attempts, and response for each question. The Item Analysis Report is a comma separated values (CSV) file that can be downloaded that provides quiz item analysis statistics for quiz questions. The item analysis is designed to help instructors assess the effectiveness of their quiz questions using measurements of reliability, difficulty, and discrimination. For more information about item analysis limitations and calculations, refer to the Item Analysis PDF. Modules Progression through Modules If you have requirements and prerequisites set up within Modules, you can track student Progress through the Module items. Progress is determined by students completing required elements, such as viewing a page, submitting an assignment or earning a minimum score on an assignment or quiz. Progress is shown as completed, in progress, or locked (cannot yet be accessed because of completion or prerequisite requirements). Modules where there are no completion requirements display as completed. Integrated Tools Turnitin Similarity Reports A Similarity Report is available for each assignment submitted to Turnitin. Similarity Reports do not indicate whether a student has plagiarized but helps to identify sources that contain textual similarities in submitted papers. The instructor must use his/her own judgment to determine if plagiarism has occurred. For more information on Similarity Reports, please see Understanding Turnitin and the Similarity Report (PDF) from U of T's Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation.

Thanks. ___________________________________ Safari display issues Advisory: Safari may not display images Safari blocks all cross-site tracking and third-party cookies. This has resulted in images not displaying. In order to display these images, users will need to navigate to their Safari settings and uncheck Prevent cross-site tracking and have these images display. ___________________________________ eMail Notifications from Quercus Advisory: Email notifications from <notifications@instructure.com> are not spam. Certain actions in Quercus may trigger a notification that is sent to the user's email address. These notifications are generated by the system and are not customizable and come from the email address <notifications@instructure.com>. Instructure is the company that makes the software use for Quercus (the software is called \"canvas\"). The notifications that are sent out are not spam, but if you are ever in doubt, manually log in to q.utoronto.ca to view any changes that the notification email describes.NB: Any of these names may appear in your interactions with the system: Quercus, Canvas, Instructure, and/or Toolbox. ___________________________________ Deferrals and Course End-Dates Advisory: When students need access to a course longer than the regular term for deferred exams or other reasons, they will still have access to a course in read-only state starting one month after the end of the session. This means that no changes need to be made to the course date settings. Students who cannot see their course on their Dashboard can access \"All Courses\" to view past enrolments and access those courses. If the instructor changes the end date of a course for active participation (submissions, discussion board posts, etc.), then the correct checkboxes must also be selected on the Course Settings page to ensure students actually have access. If an instructor actively blocks access to a course that students should have as read-only, those changes will need to be reverted for deferrals or other reasons for access. Important: When you are contacted to extend the date for a course, please contact your divisional Educational Technology team to ensure your settings are correct and students continue to have access to your course. Often, the dates do not need to be changed as students continue to have access to their courses in a read-only state even once a course has ended, but inadvertent changes to the settings may impact that access. ___________________________________ Re-Issued For Winter 2019 Semester Letter Grades Advisory: Caution should be exercised when using Letter Grades We have identified a number of potential issues regarding the use of letter grades in Quercus. Problems can occur when using Gradebook or the online assignment grading tool, SpeedGrader. It is recommended that instructors and Teaching Assistants do not enter letter grades in Gradebook or SpeedGrader, unless they follow the steps in the support document (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/letter-grades). This document outlines the issues and provides important and clear instructions on how to mitigate and work around them. Our software partner, Instructure, is aware of the concerns and is seeking to address them in a future upgrade. If you have any questions, please contact your divisional support team (https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/support#support-contacts) for this or any other Quercus matters. ___________________________________ Peer Review Tool RESOLVED: This issue was resolved on Tuesday January 8, 2019. It has come to our attention that there is a bug in the built-in peer review tool in Quercus. We have notified our software partner, who was able to reproduce the issue, and has escalated the matter immediately. Bug description: If student 1 is reviewing student 2, student 1 is able to view the comments provided to student 2 by the instructor. We will update this advisory as soon as this issue is resolved by the vendor. ___________________________________ Rich Media Files and Quercus Advisory: Please don't store large quantities of videos and photographs on Quercus Many instructors use rich media files (videos and pictures) as part of their teaching. Quercus does have some capacity to locally host such files (up to 3 gigabytes per course), however, Quercus should not serve as a media repository, because it is a specialized application suite and not a cost-affordable storage service. Luckily, U of T provides a variety of services that are meant explicitly for media, and we are actively looking at other solutions as well. To read more about those services, please visit Quercus Support https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/rich-media-files-videos-and-pictures. ___________________________________ The Module Tool Advisory: Don't forget to make the Modules Tool available in your course settings. Some instructors have been setting up Modules in the courses (we expect this to be quite a common design choice). They can do so by clicking on the Modules link in their course navigation menu. Once they create a Module, they can choose when to make it available to students. However, by default, the whole Modules tool is hidden to students. That means that an instructor who has clicked an individual module to make it available may still need to make the whole tool visible in the course navigation menu before students are able to view and access content. In the course menu, click on SETTINGS, then chose the NAVIGATION tab. Drag the Modules tool entry from the lower \"hidden\" box to the upper \"menu\" box, click save at the bottom of the page, and the Modules tool is now visible to students. For more on using Modules, please see https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/modules-and-pages or contact your local support professional https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670/pages/support#support-contacts. Advisory: When you publish a module, all of the items in that module are also published. Any modules that you want to be available to students need to be published. To publish a module, click on the Modules link on the Course Navigation menu. Then, click on the 🚫 symbol that is to the right of the module’s name. Once it turns to a green checkmark, that module is published. Publishing the module will also publish all of the items in that module. This is seen only after refreshing the webpage. You can then unpublish specific items by clicking on the green published button and verifying that it has turned back to a grey unpublished symbol. ___________________________________ The People ToolAdvisory: Recommend not using the People tool unless specifically needed The People tool is useful for instructors and course administrators who are managing their courses. The tool is available to instructors even when it is greyed out (i.e. not available for students to use). While it is fine for students in a course to know one another, it is generally advisable to keep the People tool off for students unless it is explicitly needed as part of your course design (for example, if you want to use self-sign up groups, you will need to turn on your People tool). For more specific advice on the use of the People tool in your course, please contact your divisional educational technologist. ___________________________________ Groups for Administrative Purposes Advisory: Consult with your divisional support professional before using Groups for administrative purposes Instructors that make use of either the native Quercus group tool or UT Advanced Group tool for administrative purposes (rather than for teaching purposes) should know that students will be aware that they are members of a group. If instructors don’t want students to be aware of administrative groups, there is a work-around that may be appropriate. Please contact your divisional educational technologist for support. ___________________________________ Anonymous Surveys in Quercus aren't Really Anonymous Advisory: Recommend not using the Quercus Survey tool for anything that requires anonymity The native survey tool in Quercus has an option to create an anonymous survey. However, after respondents take the survey, the instructor could change the settings, revealing the respondents identity. This is a known issue with the underlying Canvas software, which many schools have reported to the company. There is no timeline for a fix. Until they do fix it, if you really need to run an anonymous survey, please use a different tool. For example, all instructors have access to the Microsoft Forms tool, which is a simple survey tool with an anonymous capability: http://office365.utoronto.ca/about/forms/ ___________________________________ Advice on Using the Inbox/Conversations Tool Advisory: Always use the ‘Send Individual Messages’ options Instructors can use the Quercus Inbox tool to send internal messages to students (also known as the Conversations tool). When they do so, students receive a notice in their regular email that they have received a Quercus message (not unlike a notice they may receive from Facebook or Twitter). While the Inbox/Conversations tool may give the instructor the impression that tool behaves like regular email, it is much more limited (see early Quirk below). Instructors are advised to use a tool like Announcements to post important information for the whole class. If, however, an instructor does wish to use Inbox/Conversations tool, we strongly advise them to check off the box that says \"Send an individual message to each recipient\" which is akin to using the BCC field in email. Failure to do so will mean that all students will see all other students' names in the notification they receive. We have reported this as a flaw to the company. ___________________________________ Native Quercus Syllabus Tool Advisory: Avoid Use of the Native Syllabus Tool The native Syllabus tool in Quercus is not really a Syllabus - it is, at best, a site index for the course shell, automatically generated when an instructor populates their course shell with various activities. As such, we strongly recommend that instructors not enable this tool at all. A proper copy of the syllabus should be uploaded as content and featured prominently in the course, rather than using the native tool. ___________________________________ Replies sent by email to a notification are not delivered Advisory: Inform students not send you official correspondence by replying to forwarded notifications Certain Instructor actions generate a courtesy email notification that is sent to students (for example, if the Instructor posts an announcement). In theory, a student could hit \"reply\" in their personal email, but replies sent by email to a notification are not delivered. Neither the email sender, nor the intended recipient, will be notified of the email delivery failure. All users (students, instructors and teaching assistants) should reply to notification email messages by logging into Quercus (not unlike other systems, such as Facebook Messenger). A line reminding students about this is automatically added to the bottom of any such notification that a student receives via email.

            "body": "Manually Adding Instructors Instructors are assigned as the ‘owners’ of Course Websites on Quercus via an automatic feed from ROSI. Please speak to your departmental business officer or other departmental ROSI administrator to ensure that the correct instructor information is added in a timely fashion. Every so often, a new instructor (sessional of otherwise) is hired to teach a course in the next upcoming semester, but wishes to have access to their course website in advance of formally being hired and/or placed inside ROSI. By current practice, the Quercus Help team in the Centre for Teaching Support & Innovation (CTSI) cannot manually assign people to instructor roles in Quercus – that role must come from ROSI. There are a few reasons for this: (1) support staff are not in a position to adjudicate the authenticity of these requests – they have no way or authority to know if the request is legitimate – ROSI is the official source for that information; (2) assigning someone manually will later conflict with the automated ROSI feed, and can cause access problems for the instructor and department, which would then have to be rectified manually, and always after the course has actually started; and 3) having the correct instructor information on ROSI ensures the information is accurate in other systems (e.g., Course Evaluations). As stated above, under current practice, instructors should work with their local departmental contacts to ensure that timely information is added to ROSI. Instructors can also contact their local divisional Educational Technology Support team for more information. Non-instructor Access to Course Websites and Content Areas From time to time, support staff are asked to grant access to a course website on Quercus for someone other than the instructor. Quercus Help staff cannot authorize or enable access to a course website on Quercus without the instructor’s consent. Any requests for access to a course website on Quercus must be authorized by the instructor directly. If you are unable to get the instructor's permission to allow access, but still require access, please let us know, and we will forward the request to the Office of the Vice-President and Provost for adjudication. The request must include the full course ID, the instructor’s name, the date that the course will no longer be required for access, and the name and UTORid of the person who requires access to the course. As above, the reason for this practice is to avoid putting support staff in a position of adjudicating requests. Requests are made to q.help@utoronto.ca.

Quercus does have some capacity to locally host such files (up to 3 gigabytes per course), however, Quercus should not serve as a media repository, because it is a specialized application suite and not a cost-affordable storage service. Luckily, U of T provides a variety of services that are meant explicitly for media, and we are actively looking at other solutions as well. On This Page Federated Academic Digital Imaging System (FADIS) Video Streaming Services TSpace OneDrive in Microsoft Office 365 Federated Academic Digital Imaging System (FADIS) The Federated Academic Digital Imaging System (FADIS) from U of T Libraries was originally designed to house high-resolution art and architecture images, but has expanded to serve all disciples. Images loaded into FADIS can be linked to from a Quercus course. Please visit FADIS for more information. Video Streaming Services Download the Streaming Tools Comparison Chart .pdf MyMedia MyMedia, also from U of T Libraries, is an archival storage and streaming solution that provides an interface for uploading a wide array of video and audio file formats and for managing and sharing your media. It can be linked to from a Quercus course. Please visit MyMedia for more information. MS Stream Faculty and staff can use Stream to upload and share video content, students can view videos but cannot upload and share. When logged into Office 365, faculty and staff will find Stream in the suite of available apps. Please visit the Stream support site for more information. YouTube Not supported at U of T. Please see the Tools Beyond Quercus resource for more information. TSpace A third option may be TSpace, a free and secure research repository established by University of Toronto Libraries to disseminate and preserve the scholarly record of the University of Toronto community. Instructors may have already curated an integrated collection that includes multi-media components, and can use TSpace to make that collection available to their students. Again, a TSpace collection can be linked to from a Quercus course. Please visit TSpace for more information. OneDrive in Microsoft Office 365 Instructors may also want to leverage their personal OneDrive (part of their Office365 account) to store media files, that can be linked to from their Quercus course. Each instructor has up to 1 terabyte of storage in their OneDrive account. Please visit the OneDrive support site for more information. Return to Main Page Search the Quercus Support Resources"

Need a computer? Visit U of T Libraries for more information. Course Access How do I log in? The Quercus (Canvas) address is https://q.utoronto.ca . Log in using your UTORid and password. What is my UTORid? UTORid is your key to a number of University of Toronto services including institutional email and Quercus courses. To obtain a UTORid, you first need to obtain a T-Card (student identification card) from a T-Card office. Your UTORid is printed on the student card. You should also receive a printout from the T-Card office with instructions on how to activate your UTORid. I tried but I can't log in to Quercus with my UTORid You may not have activated your UTORid and password. If you are a first time UTORid user (both new and returning students) visit www.utorid.utoronto.ca and follow the instructions under “First Time users”. New students: Click here to Activate your UTORid. You will find reference to a “Secret Activation Key”. This was originally issued to you when you picked up your T-card. If you have lost your “Secret Activation Key” you can visit your campus Help Desk. Returning to UofT: If you have been with the University of Toronto for some time, or you are returning to the University and have not created a UTORid, click here to Create your UTORid then follow the instructions. Re-type your password; check that the Caps Lock is not on. Why can't I see my course card on the Dashboard when I log in to Quercus? You should see your course when you first log in to Quercus on your Dashboard, or in the Courses menu item that is located in the Global Navigation Menu on the left side of every page in Quercus. If you do not see your course select All Courses. See instructions for customizing your course list as a student. Your instructor may not have made the course available to students yet – check with your instructor or department first. You may not be registered for the course in the ACORN (formerly ROSI) system – check ACORN or with your Registrar. You may have recently registered for the course on ACORN and your course enrollment is in the process to be sent to Quercus – wait 24 to 48 hours (1-2 Business Days) for your registration to be updated in Quercus. The course may not be offered on Quercus this session – check with your department or with your Registrar. How do I remove a course from appearing on my Dashboard? When you are enrolled in more than one Quercus course, you can customize the active courses you want to show in your Course list. If you want to remove the default course card setting, you can customize the course list and manually select your favorite courses to display in the Dashboard. Additionally, in the Course Card Dashboard, you can open the Options menu for a course card, click the Move tab, and select the Unfavorite option. Unfavoriting a course requires a confirmation before the course is removed from the Dashboard. Courses can be re-added as a favorite in the Course page, which can be accessed from the Courses link in the Global Navigation Menu. I want to change my name as it appears in Quercus Official Name Change you should contact the Registrar's Office Change to Preferred First Name: If you are a student who is not employed by the University of Toronto, please go to the Office of the Registrar and request that they change your preferred first name in ACORN/ROSI. It will take 24 - 48 hours for the change to be made. Then go to https://my.auth.utoronto.ca/, select your preferred first name and click \"Set\". If you are a student who is employed by the University of Toronto, you can change your display name in Quercus by going to https://my.auth.utoronto.ca/, typing in your preferred first name and clicking \"Set\".

It demonstrates: the global menu options settings for notifications help resources and contacting your instructor navigating your course and logging out 3. There is also a mobile app for students called Canvas Student to access Quercus Mobile App Notifications: We have received reports that push notifications are not being generated on certain mobile devices. The developer for the Canvas Student and Canvas Teacher mobile apps has been notified of this. The Canvas Student app should not be used for any high-risk activities such as submitting assignments or quizzes—important tasks and assessments should be completed on a desktop or laptop computer instead. Troubleshooting Issues: The Canvas Student and Teacher mobile apps are developed by Instructure, Inc., not the University of Toronto. Please be aware that these mobile apps have limited functionality, and the service through these apps are provided \"as-is\". For a more complete experience access your courses using the desktop version. Most issues can be resolved by uninstalling and reinstalling the app from your mobile device. Additional troubleshooting and questions may have to be directed to your cellular network provider and device manufacturer. Find Your Way Around Quercus The Dashboard is the first thing you see when you log into Quercus. Your courses will display as course cards (or course tiles) in alphabetical order by course name. To access a course click on the course name in the course card. Review the Accessibility within Canvas (Quercus) guide The Global Navigation menu appears on the left hand-side of every page. From that menu you can: personalize your profile edit your notifications (see below) see a list of all your courses access the Calendar, access the Inbox and conversations access Help resources. Your Responsibility as a Student for Course Notifications and Email Make sure your email address listed in ACORN is a @mail.utoronto.ca address (or a university email address given to you by your department, for example @physics.utoronto.ca). You get a @mail.utoronto.ca address at the same time you activate your UTORid and Password. You can check your U of T email account at http://mail.utoronto.ca/. All course correspondence that is sent using Quercus is sent to a university-issued email address; this is university policy. Due to this policy, in order to receive email from Quercus, you must update ACORN with your official university-issued e-mail address. Until you do this step, you will not be able to receive email sent through Quercus by your instructor. Notification Preferences Students have the option of choosing how they receive notifications from the Quercus system by adding their preferred contact method such as SMS text messages on the Settings page. The notification settings will apply to all of your Quercus courses. Please be advised that students have the right to forward notifications to a non-university, external email provider such as Gmail, Hotmail etc., however this is not recommended. University policy on official correspondence with students states: \"Students have the right to forward their University issued electronic mail account to another electronic mail service provider address but remain responsible for ensuring that all University electronic message communication sent to the official University-issued account is received and read.\" Once contact methods are added, users can set their own Notification Preferences to select how often they want to be notified of course events. Students choose when notifications will be sent to them by selecting the appropriate icon: Daily summaries are typically sent around 6pm. Weekly summaries are typically sent on Saturdays around 6pm. View Grades The Grades page displays all current grades for course assignments. The instructor chooses to display or not display this page to students. If you do not see the Grades option in your course menu contact your instructor. Students should understand that grades posted in their Quercus course allows them early access to preliminary grades, it does not represent their official final marks. Official course grades are posted on ACORN. View Calendar The calendar tool provides students with course related information and activities, and keep track of course events. Watch a video on the calendar tool for students.

Turnitin helps students and instructors: identify common writing issues (such as citation errors), and deter plagiarism. Note: Turnitin is used for course work only. With the integration of Turnitin into Quercus courses, instructors and students should not access the program through the Turnitin.com website. Submitting a Turnitin Assignment Each time you submit a Turnitin assignment, you will be asked to accept Turnitin's terms of use by selecting the checkbox ‘I agree to the tool’s End-User License Agreement' Text Entry submissions that exceed 500 words will not generate a Similarity Report. File Upload is recommended for assignment submissions. File Type and Size Considerations Before submitting your assignment, ensure that your submission file meets the Turnitin type and size requirements. Turnitin will accept most file types (.docx, .pdf, etc..), provided they: are less than 40mb; have a minimum of 20 words; and are less than 400 pages See Turnitin File Types and Size Guidelines for more details. The Similarity Report When you submit an assignment, Turnitin generates a Similarity Report (formerly called an \"Originality Report\"). The Similarity Report highlights any passages that match other materials in the Turnitin database or on the web. For additional information on how to read and understand the Similarity Report, please refer to Understanding Turnitin and the Similarity Report. If your instructor allows, you can check the status of the Similarity Report for your assignment by clicking Submission Details. A flag with a number indicates the Similarity Score. If your instructor allows you to see the Similarity Report, you can click the score to view the report. You can also access the report from Grades. To the right of the possible points for the assignment, click the color-coded Similarity Score flag. Again, this will only work if your instructor has allowed you to see the Similarity Report. Note: If you resubmit an assignment, you must wait up to 24 hours for Turnitin to generate a new Similarity Report. Resources University of Toronto Resources How to get Turnitin to Work for You!

Quercus offers an advanced content design, a variety of student communication tools, easy-to-use course administration features, and mobile applications for access to key functions from a phone or tablet. Quercus Sandbox Course As part of Instructor training, a Quercus sandbox course was automatically created for all instructors to try out the tools, features in the course site, and begin building a fully developed course. Sandbox courses are unofficial, non-ROSI courses that do not have student enrollments. These courses are a space created for an individual instructor to experiment with a Quercus course site. Quercus for Teaching Assistants Download the Quercus for TAs tip sheet to guide them through the process of getting training, accessing resources and exploring strategies to enhance their Quercus expertise. Quercus for Students Documentation is available on the Student Quercus Guide for students with information on how to navigate Quercus, access courses and download student mobile apps. Students should be directed to the Quercus for Students blog site designed specifically for U of T students. Blog posts are written by students who share their experiences and tips when using the Quercus academic toolbox. System Status and Technical Requirements What Technology Requirements Does U of T Recommend? Which browsers does (Quercus) Canvas support? IE11 support deprecation: August 3, 2019. On August 3, Internet Explorer 11 will no longer be a supported browser. Quercus (Canvas) does support all modern web browsers however, Firefox and Chrome are recommended for use.

Unfortunately, as of this update, we have not been able to complete that process due to technical and logistical issues. At this time, instructors who wish to use TopHat’s classroom response system will have to do so via the company’s website directly. If an instructor elects to use TopHat, students will need to buy an “access code” from their campus Bookstore. To ensure that access codes will be available for the students, instructors should contact the Bookstore well in advance. Here is a link to the bookstore website page showing contacts for the adoptions:Adoption Information for Faculty (includes contact information for all three campuses) Instructors should also let their local divisional Educational Technology Support team know of their intentions to use TopHat’s classroom response system because the solution may not work in some physical locations of the University. Instructors may also be interested in best-practice information for teaching with classroom response systems. Technical assistance for use TopHat’s classroom response system should be directed tosupport@tophat.com. Finally, we are aware that TopHat sells and promotes other services, such as exam proctoring and eTextbook authoring. These additional services are not supported at the University of Toronto, and are not covered by the agreement. Only TopHat’s classroom response system is supported by the University of Toronto under its agreement with Tophat. As it pertains to eText publishing, instructors should contact their Liaison Librarian prior to engaging with any company offering to publish custom texts and course packs, as doing so might result in students being charged for access to materials already licensed by the Library.

Instructors can experiment with adding and importing content and different ways of organizing a course. Unlike an academic course calendar based course shell, the Sandbox course's lack of other members makes experimentation easier because otherwise unwanted notifications and other items are not being sent.
