Reports Troubleshooting Turnitin Contacts for Academic Integrity Support System Status Student Documentation Submitting an Assignment and Viewing the Similarity Report BEFORE creating a Turnitin Assignment instructors must adhere to the University of Toronto Conditions of Use and inform their students at the start of the course that Turnitin will be used for coursework Instructors must include the Conditions of Use statement in their course syllabus Overview Turnitin is a tool that will assist in detecting textual similarities between compared works Instructors must exercise their independent professional judgment in looking at originality report and must assume responsibility for determining whether a text has been plagiarized Turnitin is used for course work only Turnitin is an integrated tool in Quercus It appears as an option when creating an Assignment Note With the Turnitin integration in Quercus courses class and assignment setup using the Turnitincom website is not supported at U of T Conditions of Use at the University of Toronto Before setting up a Turnitin Assignment item instructors should be aware of the following 1 Instructors must include the following passage on the course outline at the start of the class Copy the text below and paste it in your course outline Please note that the statement was prepared by the University lawyers and cannot be altered in any way Normally students will be required to submit their course essays to Turnitincom for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism In doing so students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the Turnitincom reference database where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism The terms that apply to the Universitys use of the Turnitincom service are described on the Turnitincom web site 2 Students are permitted under our conditions of use to optout of using Turnitin If a student chooses not to submit their assignment through Turnitin instructors will need to find alternative arrangements to check their work as rigorously note that over the past five years very few students have opted out Students cannot be penalized for choosing to opt out 3 For any student who does not submit to Turnitin instructors can manually enter their grade in the same Gradebook column that includes the assignments that were submitted through the Turnitin assignment in your Quercus course For information on alternative methods to submitting to Turnitin see this page from the Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation Stepbystep instructions Turnitin assignments are an option when you create an assignment in your Quercus course 1 Select Assignments from the left side menu and the Assignment button at top right OR if creating this from within a module select the the button and select Assignment New Assignment 2 Within the assignments setting page when you reach the Submission Type section in the drop down select Online and make sure File Uploads is selected Text Entry may be used for short assignment submissions that are 500 words or less File Upload is recommended for assignment submissions 3 Select Turnitin from the Plagiarism Review dropdown menu that will appear Store Submission In At the University of Toronto there are two options refer to where submitted student files are stored in Turnitin paper repositories The Standard paper repository option is not available at U of T Select Institution paper repository from the dropdown menu Do not store the submitted papers Means that after the similarity check has been performed on the file submission the file will not be stored in Turnitins paper repository Compare submissions against It is recommended that all of the Compare submissions against options have been checked selected Student repository Institutional repository Website content and Periodicals journals and publications 4 Customize the Turnitin plagiarism settings to suit your assignment There is a setting at the bottom of the list to show the originality report to students Instructors can choose whether students will be able to view the Similarity Reports see Note at the end of this section for an important consideration By default the option is set to share the similarity reports with students immediately Selecting never from the drop down menu will not display the similarity reports to students Detailed instructions from Turnitin on creating a Turnitin assignment in Canvas See Turnitin File Types and Size Guidelines Turnitin will accept most file types that are less than 40mb that has a minimum of 20 words and that is less than 400 pages Note Regardless of Assignment settings students are only able to view Turnitin Similarity Reports if the assignment is unmuted via the Gradebook Similarity Reports Turnitin page on Similarity Reports accessing viewing and interpreting the report For each paper submitted a Similarity Report formerly called Originality Report is generated by Turnitin Once analyzed similarity reports highlighting questionable areas are generated within 510 minutes Similarity Reports for the second or subsequent submissions will take up to 24 hours to generate This report highlights any suspicious passages that match other materials in the Turnitin database or on the web Similarity Reports do not indicate whether a student has plagiarized but helps to identify sources that contain textual similarities in submitted papers The instructor must use hisher own judgment to determine if plagiarism has occurred For more information on Similarity Reports please see Understanding Turnitin and the Similarity Report PDF from U of Ts Centre for Teaching Support and Innovation Troubleshooting Turnitin Below are some tips for troubleshooting common situations Excluding Sources in a Similarity Report Reporting a high match eg 100 to a previous submission Removing a source from a Similarity Report will recalculate the Similarity Index without taking into account the removed source This feature is used for many reasons but is often used when a paper has been submitted twice or more to Turnitin and the Similarity Report is reporting a high match eg 100 to a previous submission Removing a source from an Similarity Report may provide a more clear similarity index percentage To exclude a source from within a Turnitin Similarity Report please do the following in your Quercus course Navigate to SpeedGrader from the Assignment or the Gradebook to view student submissions Click on the Similarity Score icon colored square containing a percentage for the submission to access the Turnitin Similarity Report From within the Turnitin Similarity Report click on the All Sources icon the horizontal bar graph icon with a downwardpointing arrow located in the red icon group to the right Click the Exclude Sources button to the bottom right corner Click on the checkboxes next to the sources you want to exclude Click the red Exclude button at the bottom of the page It is possible to exclude up to 1000 sources from a single report Note Excluding sources from a report will recalculate the similarity score in the Turnitin Similarity Report These changes will be saved in the Similarity Report but will not be reflected in the Similarity Score Icon in the Speedgrader Viewing and Restoring Excluded Sources To view excluded sources click on the red Excluded Sources icon button in the red icon group looks like a circle with a line through it To restore any or all excluded sources click on the checkbox next to the source youd like to restore or the restore all button Click the Restore button The restored sources will automatically update the Similarity Report and will be reflected in the similarity score Turnitin Red Icon Group Contacts for Academic Integrity Support Instructors who have questions about the process for the handling of suspected academic offences should contact their departmentdivision in many cases this would be the undergraduate chair or associate chairdean In addition divisional offices or individuals are also available to provide advice regarding particular academic integrity issues or to discuss a specific situation These include Academic Integrity at the University of Toronto Office of Student Academic Integrity OSAI at the Faculty of Arts and Science

questions or concerns or notice any other issues please contact your divisional educational technologist or write to qhelputorontoca Thanks ___________________________________ ReIssued For Winter 2019 Semester Letter Grades Advisory Caution should be exercised when using Letter Grades We have identified a number of potential issues regarding the use of letter grades in Quercus Problems can occur when using Gradebook or the online assignment grading tool SpeedGrader It is recommended that instructors and Teaching Assistants do not enter letter grades in Gradebook or SpeedGrader unless they follow the steps in the support document httpsqutorontocacourses46670pageslettergrades This document outlines the issues and provides important and clear instructions on how to mitigate and work around them Our software partner Instructure is aware of the concerns and is seeking to address them in a future upgrade If you have any questions please contact your divisional support team httpsqutorontocacourses46670pagessupportsupportcontacts for this or any other Quercus matters ___________________________________ Peer Review Tool RESOLVED This issue was resolved on Tuesday January 8 2019 It has come to our attention that there is a bug in the builtin peer review tool in Quercus We have notified our software partner who was able to reproduce the issue and has escalated the matter immediately Bug description If student 1 is reviewing student 2 student 1 is able to view the comments provided to student 2 by the instructor We will update this advisory as soon as this issue is resolved by the vendor ___________________________________ Rich Media Files and Quercus Advisory Please dont store large quantities of videos and photographs on Quercus Many instructors use rich media files videos and pictures as part of their teaching Quercus does have some capacity to locally host such files up to 3 gigabytes per course however Quercus should not serve as a media repository because it is a specialized application suite and not a costaffordable storage service Luckily U of T provides a variety of services that are meant explicitly for media and we are actively looking at other solutions as well To read more about those services please visit Quercus Support httpsqutorontocacourses46670pagesrichmediafilesvideosandpictures ___________________________________ The Module Tool Advisory Dont forget to make the Modules Tool available in your course settings Some instructors have been setting up Modules in the courses we expect this to be quite a common design choice They can do so by clicking on the Modules link in their course navigation menu Once they create a Module they can choose when to make it available to students However by default the whole Modules tool is hidden to students That means that an instructor who has clicked an individual module to make it available may still need to make the whole tool visible in the course navigation menu before students are able to view and access content In the course menu click on SETTINGS then chose the NAVIGATION tab Drag the Modules tool entry from the lower hidden box to the upper menu box click save at the bottom of the page and the Modules tool is now visible to students For more on using Modules please see httpsqutorontocacourses46670pagesmodulesandpages or contact your local support professional httpsqutorontocacourses46670pagessupportsupportcontacts Advisory When you publish a module all of the items in that module are also published Any modules that you want to be available to students need to be published To publish a module click on the Modules link on the Course Navigation menu Then click on the symbol that is to the right of the modules name Once it turns to a green checkmark that module is published Publishing the module will also publish all of the items in that module This is seen only after refreshing the webpage You can then unpublish specific items by clicking on the green published button and verifying that it has turned back to a grey unpublished symbol ___________________________________ The People ToolAdvisory Recommend not using the People tool unless specifically needed The People tool is useful for instructors and course administrators who are managing their courses The tool is available to instructors even when it is greyed out ie not available for students to use While it is fine for students in a course to know one another it is generally advisable to keep the People tool off for students unless it is explicitly needed as part of your course design for example if you want to use selfsign up groups you will need to turn on your People tool For more specific advice on the use of the People tool in your course please contact your divisional educational technologist ___________________________________ Groups for Administrative Purposes Advisory Consult with your divisional support professional before using Groups for administrative purposes Instructors that make use of either the native Quercus group tool or UT Advanced Group tool for administrative purposes rather than for teaching purposes should know that students will be aware that they are members of a group If instructors dont want students to be aware of administrative groups there is a workaround that may be appropriate Please contact your divisional educational technologist for support ___________________________________ Anonymous Surveys in Quercus arent Really Anonymous Advisory Recommend not using the Quercus Survey tool for anything that requires anonymity The native survey tool in Quercus has an option to create an anonymous survey However after respondents take the survey the instructor could change the settings revealing the respondents identity This is a known issue with the underlying Canvas software which many schools have reported to the company There is no timeline for a fix Until they do fix it if you really need to run an anonymous survey please use a different tool For example all instructors have access to the Microsoft Forms tool which is a simple survey tool with an anonymous capability httpoffice365utorontocaaboutforms ___________________________________ Advice on Using the InboxConversations Tool Advisory Always use the Send Individual Messages options Instructors can use the Quercus Inbox tool to send internal messages to students also known as the Conversations tool When they do so students receive a notice in their regular email that they have received a Quercus message not unlike a notice they may receive from Facebook or Twitter While the InboxConversations tool may give the instructor the impression that tool behaves like regular email it is much more limited see early Quirk below Instructors are advised to use a tool like Announcements to post important information for the whole class If however an instructor does wish to use InboxConversations tool we strongly advise them to check off the box that says Send an individual message to each recipient which is akin to using the BCC field in email Failure to do so will mean that all students will see all other students names in the notification they receive We have reported this as a flaw to the company ___________________________________ Native Quercus Syllabus Tool Advisory Avoid Use of the Native Syllabus Tool The native Syllabus tool in Quercus is not really a Syllabus it is at best a site index for the course shell automatically generated when an instructor populates their course shell with various activities As such we strongly recommend that instructors not enable this tool at all A proper copy of the syllabus should be uploaded as content and featured prominently in the course rather than using the native tool ___________________________________ Replies sent by email to a notification are not delivered Advisory Inform students not send you official correspondence by replying to forwarded notifications Certain Instructor actions generate a courtesy email notification that is sent to students for example if the Instructor posts an announcement In theory a student could hit reply in their personal email but replies sent by email to a notification are not delivered Neither the email sender nor the intended recipient will be notified of the email delivery failure All users students instructors and teaching assistants should reply to notification email messages by logging into Quercus not unlike other systems such as Facebook Messenger A line reminding students about this is automatically added to the bottom of any such notification that a student receives via email Read more about this and related support on our Notifications support page"

    "body": "Overview MasteryPaths is a Feature Option in Quercus and currently in Beta mode This means that some elements are still under development and being tested by Instructure Canvas MasteryPaths allows instructors to customize or differentiate learning based on student performance Instructors identify different activities for each learning path to help students in that path to achieve mastery Source and Conditional Release Items In MasteryPaths students complete a graded Source item a quiz assignment or discussion After the Source item has been graded either manually or automatically the students score designates which Conditional Release items they are assigned as a learning path Note If you are interested in using MasteryPaths we suggest that you first consult with your Divisional support representative or contact qhelputorontoca On This Page Enabling MasteryPaths Setting Up a MasteryPath Important Considerations Pedagogical Uses Support Resources Enabling MasteryPaths To enable MasteryPaths in your Quercus course 1 Click on Settings in the Course Navigation menu 2 On the Feature Options tab click the MasteryPaths slider to ON The slider will be green when activated Setting Up a MasteryPath A MasteryPath originates from the course modules page Before designating Source and Conditional Release items all assignments and pages should be finalized and added to the module as module items before the MasteryPath is published 1 Create the Source Item In a Module create the Source item The Source MUST be a graded assignment discussion or quiz A graded quiz that with multiple attempts available can serve as a Source item This allows students to take progressively more challenging paths as their score improves If the Source item requires manual grading contains textbased responses you will need to input the grades in the Gradebook and unmute the assignment before students can access the Conditional Release items in their learning path 2 Create the Conditional Release Items In the same Module create the Conditional Release items These items form the content of each learning path Any course item except practice quizzes and ungraded surveys may be designated as Conditional Release items 3 Allow Conditional Release Items for the MasteryPath Pages If you want to add a page as a Conditional Release item you must first allow the page in MasteryPaths In the module open the page by clicking on the name of the page Click the Edit button At the bottom of the page click the Allow in Mastery paths checkbox Click the Save button Assignments Quizzes and Discussions By default assignments quizzes and discussions are assigned to Everyone this means all students are able to view them To use these items as Conditional Release items in a MasteryPath they must be Assigned to MasteryPaths Click on the assignment quiz or discussion Click the Edit button Scroll to the Assign to box and delete Everyone Select MasteryPaths Click Save 4 Configure the MasteryPath Configuring the MasteryPath involves designating the Source item and all your Conditional Release items for each path Click on the name of the Source item Click the Edit button and select the Mastery Paths tab There are a maximum of three paths that can be created Review the performance ranges for each path and adjust if needed by selecting the points boxes and typing in your preferred range The example below shows the possible point ranges or paths for a Quiz with a total of 20 points For each path click the to select Conditional Release from the list of items that you have already added to the module These items are assigned to specific student through conditional rules in the three scoring ranges Search for the conditional content 1 or use the dropdown menu 2 to select the type of conditional content you want to add Check the box next to the items you want to add 3 and click the Add Items button 4 If you do not want to assign any content to the students in a particular range you may leave that path blank When more than one item is added to a range by default students will be required to complete all of the items as noted by the button If you want to give students a choice between items in a path click the button The items will separate and the will change to an Or button This allows students to select which items to complete as part of the path Note Each of the options must be distinct at the path level It is not possible to have a hierarchy within a path or to nest the or Or options Important Considerations 1 Source Item The Source item that launches the paths must be a GRADED item and will therefore impact students course grade If you do not want performance in the Source item to impact course grades you may need to adjust scores manually before final grades are calculated You will also need to communicate this clearly to students because they will see that they have scored a certain number of points associated with this assessment 2 Conditional Release Items If there are graded items within the paths ensure that the total number of points available is the same for each path 3 Testing the MasteryPath Always test your MasteryPath in Student View before making it available to students It is much easier to make adjustments to the MasteryPath before any of your students have started working on the Source item Pedagogical Uses MasteryPaths is intended to help differentiate learning experiences for students while maintaining course outcomes and standards Within the University of Toronto context MasteryPaths may be helpful in achieving the following pedagogical goals Providing students with enrichment andor review opportunities Providing students with choice of assignment topics or types of assignment submissions or Providing students with choice of learning materials according to their learning preferences view a video or read an article for example Support Resources How do I use
